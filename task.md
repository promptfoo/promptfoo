## Findings Since Last Audit

- Navigation improved: `Navigation.tsx` adds a Model Audit dropdown with direct links to `/model-audit` and `/model-audit/history` for better discoverability.
- Results UX: `ModelAudit.tsx` shows a success alert after a persisted scan with a direct link to the specific result (`/model-audit/history/:id`).
- Tests: `ModelAuditResult.test.tsx` exists and covers loading, success, error, delete, download, and rendering of ResultsTab. Basic tests for History exist (`ModelAuditHistory.test.tsx`, `page.test.tsx`) but are MVP-level; they should be expanded to cover toolbar, quick filter, CSV export, selection, and navigation.
- Store duplication: `useModelAuditStore` still includes history state/actions while History page fetches independently via `callApi`, creating redundant logic and risk of drift.
- Route naming: Align plan with implemented route `/model-audit/history/:id` (instead of `/model-audit/scan/:id`).

## Critique & Adjustments

- State management: Either split out a dedicated `useModelAuditHistoryStore` and use it in `ModelAuditHistory`, or remove history fields/actions from the monolithic store to avoid dead code.
- Data strategy: Client-side pagination is implemented; add server-side pagination/sort/search (`limit`, `offset`, `search`, `sort`, `order`) to `GET /api/model-audit/scans` for large datasets.
- Testing gaps: Expand `ModelAuditHistory` tests to cover toolbar presence, quick filter behavior, CSV export visibility, selection constraints for focused row, navigation on row/cell click, and error/empty overlays. Remove/adjust any legacy tests referencing the deleted HistoryTab.
- Types: In `ModelAuditResult`, replace `any` for `results` with the `ScanResult` type for stronger guarantees.
- Accessibility: Ensure IconButtons (download, delete, back, refresh) have `aria-label`s and DataGrid link cells are accessible.
- Telemetry (optional): Consider explicit events for history/result interactions (row click, delete, export) beyond page views.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture
The Model Audit feature currently operates as a single-page application (`src/app/src/pages/model-audit/`) with three tabs:

1. **Configuration Tab** (`ConfigurationTab.tsx`) - Path selection and scan options
2. **Results Tab** (`ResultsTab.tsx`) - Display scan results with detailed findings
3. **History Tab** (`HistoryTab.tsx`) - Show historical scans in a basic MUI Table

### Current Issues & Limitations

#### User Experience Problems
- **Single-page complexity**: All functionality crammed into one page creates cognitive overload
- **Poor history navigation**: Basic table lacks advanced filtering, sorting, and search capabilities
- **Limited discoverability**: History is hidden behind a tab, reducing scan visibility
- **No direct access**: Cannot directly navigate to specific historical scans via URL
- **Poor mobile experience**: Single-page layout doesn't adapt well to smaller screens

#### Technical Debt
- **Mixed UI patterns**: History uses basic MUI Table while evals use sophisticated DataGrid
- **State management complexity**: All tabs share the same Zustand store, causing tight coupling
- **Performance**: Loading all scan history into a single table doesn't scale
- **Code organization**: Large components with multiple responsibilities

### Comparative Analysis: Evals vs Model Audit

| Feature | Evals DataGrid | Model Audit History |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Component | MUI X DataGrid | Basic MUI Table |
| Search | Built-in QuickFilter | None |
| Sorting | Multi-column, persistent | None |
| Pagination | Built-in with size options | None |
| Filtering | Advanced column filters | None |
| Export | CSV export capability | None |
| Selection | Row selection support | None |
| Styling | Professional, consistent | Basic table styling |
| Performance | Virtualized rendering | Loads all data |
| URL routing | Direct eval navigation | No direct access |

## Design Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Move scan history to dedicated page
2. **Feature Parity**: Match the sophistication of the EvalsDataGrid
3. **Navigation**: Direct URL access to scan history and individual scans
4. **Search & Filter**: Advanced search capabilities across all scan metadata
5. **Performance**: Handle large numbers of historical scans efficiently
6. **Export**: Allow users to export scan history and results
7. **Mobile Responsive**: Excellent experience across all device sizes

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Minimal Backend Changes**: Reuse existing API endpoints where possible
2. **Consistent UI/UX**: Follow established patterns from evals and reports
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing workflows should continue to work
4. **Performance**: Sub-second load times for scan history
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliance
6. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration test coverage

## Design Options

## Option A: Full Separation with DataGrid (Recommended)

### Architecture
```
/model-audit              → Scan configuration and execution
/model-audit/history      → Scan history with DataGrid
/model-audit/scan/:id     → Individual scan details
```

### Implementation Details

#### New Components
1. **`ModelAuditHistoryPage.tsx`** - Dedicated history page with DataGrid
2. **`ModelAuditHistoryDataGrid.tsx`** - Sophisticated data grid (following EvalsDataGrid pattern)
3. **`ModelAuditScanDetailPage.tsx`** - Individual scan view page
4. **`ModelAuditScanDetailView.tsx`** - Reusable scan detail component

#### Modified Components
1. **`ModelAudit.tsx`** - Simplified to only Configuration and Results tabs
2. **`HistoryTab.tsx`** - Replace with navigation to history page
3. **Navigation components** - Add history page to navigation

#### State Management
- **Split stores**: Separate configuration store from history store
- **`useModelAuditConfigStore`** - For scan configuration and execution
- **`useModelAuditHistoryStore`** - For scan history management
- **Shared utilities** - Common API calls and data transformations

#### Routing Updates
```typescript
// In App.tsx routing
<Route path="/model-audit" element={<ModelAudit />} />
<Route path="/model-audit/history" element={<ModelAuditHistoryPage />} />
<Route path="/model-audit/scan/:id" element={<ModelAuditScanDetailPage />} />

## Next Actions and Guidance for Agents

- Split stores: Extract history concerns from `src/app/src/pages/model-audit/store.ts` into a dedicated `useModelAuditHistoryStore`. Keep configuration/scan state in `useModelAuditConfigStore`. Update components accordingly and remove unused state.
- Server-side data (optional but recommended): Extend `GET /api/model-audit/scans` to accept `limit`, `offset`, `search`, `sort`, `order`; wire DataGrid to these for large datasets. Keep client page size default at 50 and debounce quick filter.
- Tests to add/update: Unit tests for `ModelAuditHistory` (loading, error, empty, navigation on click, quick filter, CSV export), `ModelAuditResult` (fetch success/error, delete, download, breadcrumbs), and the new stores. Remove or adjust any tests referencing the removed History tab.
- Navigation/discoverability: Current top nav includes “Model Audit”; history is accessible via in-page CTA and breadcrumbs. Add a separate “Model Audit History” nav item only if it improves discoverability without cluttering mobile.
- Accessibility polish: Ensure IconButtons on the Result page have `aria-label`s; verify DataGrid link cells are accessible and meet contrast guidelines; consider loading skeletons.

Suggested split of work while collaborating:
- Agent A: Store split + component wiring + store tests.
- Agent B: Server-side pagination/search (API + UI) + component tests + accessibility polish.
