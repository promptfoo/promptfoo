# Asset Storage System Audit Report

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Deduplicated Assets Not Served Correctly** (HIGH SEVERITY)
**Location**: `src/server/routes/assets.ts` line 50
**Issue**: The asset endpoint constructs file path directly without checking if asset is deduplicated. Deduplicated assets don't have actual files, only metadata pointing to original.
**Impact**: 404 errors when trying to serve deduplicated assets
**Fix Required**: Check metadata for `dedupedFrom` field and resolve to original file path

### 2. **Race Condition in Deduplicator Initialization** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Location**: `src/assets/index.ts` constructor
**Issue**: Deduplicator initialization is async but not awaited, could cause race conditions if save() called immediately
**Impact**: First few saves might not be deduplicated properly
**Fix Required**: Add initialization check in save() method

### 3. **Memory Scalability Issue** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Location**: `src/assets/dedup.ts`
**Issue**: Entire deduplication index loaded into memory
**Impact**: High memory usage in large deployments
**Fix Required**: Consider using SQLite or streaming approach for large indexes

### 4. **Missing Validation in Provider Integrations** (MEDIUM SEVERITY)
**Location**: All converted providers
**Issue**: No validation that evalId/resultId are valid UUIDs before saving
**Impact**: Could save assets with invalid paths
**Fix Required**: Add UUID validation in providers

### 5. **Incomplete Error Handling** (LOW SEVERITY)
**Location**: Various providers
**Issue**: Some providers don't handle all asset storage failure scenarios
**Impact**: Inconsistent error messages
**Fix Required**: Standardize error handling across providers

## Missing Features

### 1. **No Cleanup Integration**
- Asset cleanup utility not integrated with database cleanup
- No automatic cleanup based on eval deletion
- No garbage collection for orphaned deduplicated references

### 2. **No Size Limits Per Eval**
- No limits on total asset size per evaluation
- Could lead to disk space exhaustion
- No quota management

### 3. **No Asset Type Validation**
- MIME types not validated against actual content
- Could save invalid files
- Security risk

### 4. **No Concurrent Write Protection**
- Multiple processes could write same asset simultaneously
- Could corrupt deduplication index
- Need file locking

## Security Concerns

### 1. **Path Traversal Protection**
- Current validation only checks individual IDs
- Need to validate full constructed paths
- Should use path.normalize() before checks

### 2. **MIME Type Spoofing**
- No validation that MIME type matches content
- Could serve malicious content with wrong type
- Need magic number validation

### 3. **Missing Rate Limiting**
- No rate limiting on asset endpoints
- Could be used for DoS attacks
- Need request throttling

## Performance Issues

### 1. **No Streaming for Large Files**
- Files loaded entirely into memory
- Could cause OOM for large assets
- Need streaming API

### 2. **Synchronous Index Saves**
- Deduplication index saved synchronously
- Blocks asset saves
- Should be async/queued

### 3. **No Caching Headers**
- Assets served without proper caching
- Repeated downloads
- Need ETag support

## Edge Cases Not Handled

### 1. **Disk Full Scenarios**
- No handling for ENOSPC errors
- Could leave partial files
- Need space checking

### 2. **Corrupted Metadata**
- No recovery for corrupted JSON files
- Would make assets inaccessible
- Need validation/recovery

### 3. **Network Interruptions**
- No resume support for large uploads
- Would fail entire operation
- Need chunked upload support

### 4. **Clock Skew**
- Uses Date.now() for timestamps
- Could cause ordering issues
- Should use monotonic clock

## Testing Gaps

### 1. **No Integration Tests**
- No tests for full provider -> storage -> API flow
- No tests for deduplicated asset serving
- No concurrent operation tests

### 2. **No Error Scenario Tests**
- No tests for disk full
- No tests for corrupted files
- No tests for permission errors

### 3. **No Performance Tests**
- No tests for large files
- No tests for many small files
- No load testing

### 4. **No Security Tests**
- No tests for path traversal
- No tests for MIME validation
- No tests for rate limiting

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. Fix deduplicated asset serving in API endpoint
2. Add initialization check for deduplicator
3. Add UUID validation in all providers
4. Add comprehensive test suite

### Short-term Improvements:
1. Add concurrent write protection
2. Implement proper error recovery
3. Add security validations
4. Improve caching strategy

### Long-term Enhancements:
1. Move to database-backed deduplication
2. Add streaming support for large files
3. Implement quota management
4. Add monitoring and alerting

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. **Inconsistent Error Messages**
- Different error formats across providers
- Makes debugging difficult
- Need standardized error types

### 2. **Missing TypeScript Strict Checks**
- Some any types used
- Could hide type errors
- Should enable strict mode

### 3. **Insufficient Logging**
- Missing debug logs in critical paths
- No structured logging
- Need better observability

### 4. **No API Documentation**
- Missing OpenAPI/Swagger docs
- No usage examples
- Need comprehensive docs
