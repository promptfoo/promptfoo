## June 2025 - Financial security & enterprise features

### Promptfoo (Core / Eval)

- [Helicone AI Gateway](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/providers/helicone/) provider added
- [Hyperbolic image and audio providers](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/providers/hyperbolic/) support added
- Provider support: Mistral Magistral reasoning models, Gemini models include latest 2.5 Pro Preview and Flash
- Tracing for agents!! Promptfoo [collects OpenTelemetry data](/docs/tracing/) and displays it in the UI. Less external observability infrastructure - excellent
- Performance: Better handling for large high concurrency evals
- Model audit: Support for every major ML format and dashboard in Promptfoo

### Red team

- Multi-turn redteam strategies are smarter and can answer questions like “Pick A or B” before continuing attack
- [Unblock multiturn](/docs/red-team/strategies/multi-turn/) added
- [Financial plugins](/docs/red-team/plugins/financial/) added
- [Bias plugins](/docs/red-team/plugins/gender-bias/) added
- defaultTest variables to red team setup UI added

## May 2025 - Quality assurance tools

### Features

- Target discovery agent - AI-powered vulnerability detection
- xAI integration - Model context protocol support
- Off-topic plugin - Focus validation for AI systems
- Validation command - Configuration quality assurance
- Server-side pagination for handling thousands of eval results
- Enhanced data export with multiple formats and metadata
- Universal environment variables for configuration flexibility

#### Red teaming

- New security plugins:
  - Off-topic detection - Ensures AI stays on task
  - MCP (Model Context Protocol) - Tests tool usage vulnerabilities
  - Gender bias - Detects discriminatory outputs
  - EU AI Act mappings - Compliance testing

- Better jailbreak detection

### Bug fixes

- Fixed SQL extraction in analytics
- Resolved WebUI crash on certain configs
- Improved memory usage in large evaluations

## March 2025 - Multimodal security features

### Features

- LiteLLM integration - 100+ providers in a single interface
- JSONL support - Large-scale evaluations
- Foundation model testing - Transformer-based model testing
- Performance: Improved caching system (45% faster evals) and better memory management for large datasets

#### Red teaming

- Fuzzing & mutation strategies: camelCase (tests case-sensitive parsing), dateFormatter (probes date/time vulnerabilities),and mathInjection (tests numeric overflows).
- Purpose discovery - AI agent automatic system capability discovery

### Bug fixes:

- Fixed console.log encoding issues
