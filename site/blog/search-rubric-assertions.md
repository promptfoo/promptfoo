# Real-Time Fact Checking for LLM Outputs

Two U.S. federal judges recently withdrew rulings containing AI-generated citations that didn't exist.

This type of error happens because LLM outputs often include outdated or incorrect information from training data. Traditional assertion types check format and style, but can't verify current facts.

We're releasing search-rubric assertions that verify time-sensitive information during testing.

<!-- truncate -->

## How It Works

The search-rubric assertion works like llm-rubric but with web search capabilities:

```yaml
assert:
  - type: search-rubric
    value: 'Provides accurate AAPL stock price within 2% of current market value'
```

When evaluating, the assertion:

1. Uses your rubric to understand what to verify
2. Searches the web if current information is needed
3. Grades the output based on the rubric criteria
4. Returns pass/fail with a score from 0.0 to 1.0

## Example

Here's a complete test configuration:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
providers:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini

tests:
  - prompt: "What's the current stock price of {{company}}?"
    assert:
      - type: search-rubric
        value: |
          States the current {{ticker}} stock price that:
          1. Is within 3% of actual market price
          2. Includes currency (USD)
          3. Mentions if market is currently open or closed
    vars:
      company: Apple
      ticker: AAPL
```

If the model responds with outdated price information from its training data, the test will fail.

## Use Cases

Web-search assertions are useful when testing outputs that contain:

- Current stock prices or financial data
- Today's weather conditions
- Recent news or events
- Business hours or availability
- Real-time statistics

Traditional assertions can't catch when an LLM confidently states last year's stock price or yesterday's weather.

## Supported Providers

Web search requires a provider with search capabilities. All major providers now support this:

- **Anthropic** (May 2025): Configure with `web_search_20250305` tool
- **OpenAI**: Use `web_search_preview` tool with responses API
- **Google/Vertex**: Built-in `googleSearch` tool
- **Perplexity**: Native web search, no configuration needed
- **xAI**: Enable with `search_parameters`

## When to Use Web Search

| Use case                         | Keep `llm-rubric` | Add `search-rubric` |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| Fiction, tone, UX copy           | ✓                 |                     |
| API docs, math, finance          |                   | ✓                   |
| Real-time data (weather, stocks) |                   | ✓                   |
| Academic citations               |                   | ✓                   |

## Real Examples

### Financial Services

```yaml
# Verify real-time market data
assert:
  - type: search-rubric
    value: |
      Provides S&P 500 index value that:
      - Is within 1% of current market value
      - Includes point change from previous close
      - States whether markets are open or closed
```

### Legal Tech

```yaml
# Confirm case citations exist
assert:
  - type: search-rubric
    value: |
      Correctly cites Miranda v. Arizona including:
      - Accurate case citation (384 U.S. 436)
      - Correct year (1966)
      - Key holding about right to remain silent
```

### Healthcare

```yaml
# Validate FDA approvals
assert:
  - type: search-rubric
    value: 'States correct FDA approval date for Leqembi (should be January 2023) and its approved use'
```

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

```bash
npm install -g promptfoo@latest
```

### With Grading Provider

Specify a search-rubric capable provider for grading:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
grading:
  provider: openai:responses:o4-mini
  providerOptions:
    config:
      tools: [{ type: web_search_preview }]

tests:
  - prompt: "What's the weather in Tokyo?"
    assert:
      - type: search-rubric
        value: |
          Describes current Tokyo weather with:
          - Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit
          - Current conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.)
          - Any active weather warnings if applicable
```

### Auto-Detection

If no grading provider is specified, Promptfoo will automatically select one with web search capabilities based on available API keys.

## Performance and Costs

Web search adds approximately 2-3 seconds per assertion.

Pricing varies by provider:

- **OpenAI**: $0.003-0.008 per search
- **Anthropic**: $10 per 1,000 searches ($0.01 each)
- **Perplexity**: Varies by model tier
- **Google**: Included in standard API pricing

For a typical test suite with 50 search-rubric assertions, expect to pay $0.15-0.50 per run.

To reduce costs during development:

```bash
promptfoo eval --cache
```

## Provider Configuration

```yaml title="Provider setup examples"
providers:
  # Anthropic - requires web search tool
  - id: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    config:
      tools:
        - type: web_search_20250305
          name: web_search
          max_uses: 5

  # OpenAI - requires tool config
  - id: openai:o4-mini
    config:
      tools:
        - type: web_search_preview

  # Google - uses googleSearch
  - id: google:gemini-2.5-flash
    config:
      tools:
        - googleSearch

  # Perplexity - built-in search
  - perplexity:sonar-large
```

## Best Practices

**Write clear rubrics like llm-rubric:**

```yaml
# Good - specific criteria
- type: search-rubric
  value: 'Names Satya Nadella as the current CEO of Microsoft'

# Too vague
- type: search-rubric
  value: 'talks about tech leadership'
```

**Set appropriate thresholds:**

```yaml
# Allow flexibility for volatile data
- type: search-rubric
  value: 'Provides Bitcoin price in USD within 10% of current market value'
  threshold: 0.8 # 80% score required
```

**Cache during development:**

```bash
# Avoid repeated searches while iterating
promptfoo eval --cache
```

## Common Issues

**"No provider with web search capabilities"**

Ensure your grading provider has web search configured:

```yaml
grading:
  provider: openai:responses:o4-mini
  providerOptions:
    config:
      tools: [{ type: web_search_preview }]
```

**Timeouts**

Web searches can be slow. Increase timeout if needed:

```yaml
assert:
  - type: search-rubric
    value: 'complex query'
    timeout: 10000 # 10 seconds
```
