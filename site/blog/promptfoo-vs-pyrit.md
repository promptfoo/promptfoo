# Promptfoo vs PyRIT: A Practical Comparison of LLM Red Teaming Tools

As enterprises deploy AI applications at scale, red teaming has become essential for identifying vulnerabilities before they reach production. Two prominent open-source tools have emerged in this space: Promptfoo and Microsoft's PyRIT.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature               | Promptfoo                        | PyRIT                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Setup Time**        | Minutes (Web/CLI wizard)         | Hours (Python scripting) |
| **Attack Generation** | Automatic, context-aware         | Manual configuration     |
| **RAG Testing**       | Pre-built tests                  | Manual configuration     |
| **Agent Security**    | RBAC, tool misuse tests included | Manual configuration     |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Built-in                         | Requires custom code     |
| **Reporting**         | Visual dashboards, OWASP mapping | Raw outputs              |
| **Learning Curve**    | Low                              | High                     |
| **Best For**          | Continuous security testing      | Custom deep-dives        |

**Key Takeaway**: Promptfoo is like a security scanner for AI apps - automated and developer-friendly. PyRIT is like a security _framework_ - it provides building blocks but requires expertise to implement.

## Different Tools for Different Teams

**Promptfoo** is a red teaming toolkit designed for engineering teams building AI applications. It dynamically generates application-specific attacks using specialized models, testing for vulnerabilities like prompt injections, data leaks, and unauthorized tool usage. The tool integrates directly into CI/CD pipelines and provides actionable security reports.

**PyRIT (Python Risk Identification Toolkit)** is a Python framework from Microsoft's AI Red Team that provides building blocks for creating custom red teaming scenarios. It enables security researchers to orchestrate AI-vs-AI attacks, where an attacker agent attempts to exploit a target system while a judge evaluates the results.

## Attack Generation: Automated vs. Customizable

The tools take fundamentally different approaches to generating attacks:

### Promptfoo: Context-Aware Automation

- Generates thousands of application-specific attacks automatically
- Adapts prompts based on your app's purpose (e.g., "banking chatbot" gets finance-specific attacks)
- No generic prompts - every attack is tailored to your use case
- Uses specialized uncensored models for attack generation

### PyRIT: Flexible Framework

- Provides attack converters (Base64, ASCII art, persuasion techniques)
- Requires manual goal definition (e.g., tester comes up with "extract account transaction history" and similar test cases)
- Requires Python scripting

## Technical Security Coverage

Both tools address core LLM security risks, but with different areas of focus:

### RAG and Data Security

Promptfoo's Built-in RAG Tests:

- Direct and indirect prompt injections
- Unauthorized data retrieval
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) violations
- Context poisoning attacks
- Automatic testing via web UI

PyRIT's RAG Capabilities:

- Direct and indirect prompt injections
- Ability to set up tests for RBAC violations and data retrieval using custom Python implementation

### Agent and Tool Misuse

Promptfoo provides pre-built tests for:

- Unauthorized tool execution
- Privilege escalation attempts
- API misuse (BOLA, BFLA)
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

PyRIT includes:

- Multi-turn attacks developed by Microsoft
- The ability to construct custom tool abuse scenarios in Python

## Integration and Workflow

### Promptfoo: Built for DevSecOps

```bash
# Setup in minutes
npx promptfoo@latest redteam setup

# Run in CI/CD
promptfoo redteam run

# View results
promptfoo redteam report
```

**Features:**

- Direct CI/CD integration with pass/fail
- Visual reports with severity ratings
- Maps findings to OWASP Top 10 and other frameworks for LLMs
- Tests APIs, endpoints, or browser interfaces
- Optional customization via Python or Javascript scripting

### PyRIT: Built for Flexibility

PyRIT requires Python scripting.

```python
# Requires custom implementation
from pyrit import Orchestrator, AttackerAgent

orchestrator = Orchestrator()
attacker = AttackerAgent(goal="Extract user data")
results = orchestrator.run(attacker, target)
```

**Features:**

- Extensible through Python classes
- Integrates with Python workflows
- Best for one-off assessments
- Requires result interpretation

## Community and Ecosystem

### Promptfoo

- 100,000+ users since 2023
- Used by 27 Fortune 500 companies
- Featured in OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS course materials
- Regular updates for new attack techniques
- Active Discord and GitHub community

### PyRIT

- Created by Microsoft AI Red Team
- Used in Microsoft red team engagements
- Pure open-source
- Relies on off-the-shelf models
- Regular updates for new attack techniques

Promptfoo offers ISO 27001 compliance and enterprise support. PyRIT is pure open-source with community support.

## Standards, Compliance, and Reporting

Promptfoo maps results to OWASP, NIST RMF, MITRE ATLAS, and the EU AI Act, producing ready‑to‑share reports.

## Enterprise Readiness

For organizations evaluating these tools at scale, enterprise features and support can be a key decision point. While both PyRIT and Promptfoo are open-source, Promptfoo has an Enterprise edition.

Available in Promptfoo Enterprise:

- On-premise deployment - Run entirely within your infrastructure
- Professional support with SLAs
- Team collaboration - Shared dashboards and test management
- Advanced analytics - Track security metrics over time
- SSO/SAML integration - Seamless authentication

The enterprise version also includes a web-based dashboard where teams can:

- Manage and version control test suites
- Track vulnerability trends across releases
- Generate executive-ready compliance reports
- Set up automated alerts for failed security tests

## Making the Right Choice

In general, Promptfoo is a good choice if you:

✅ Want comprehensive coverage without heavy custom code  
✅ Need continuous security testing in CI/CD  
✅ Prefer automated scanning with reporting
✅ Need compliance reporting (OWASP, NIST)

PyRIT is a good choice if you:

✅ Have dedicated security researchers  
✅ Prefer programmatic control
✅ Enjoy writing Python and building tools

The tools are ultimately quite different. Promptfoo's adversarial models remove the need to manually come up with hundreds of test cases yourself. PyRIT provides a lot of scripting power, whereas Promptfoo is extensible but easier to integrate up-front.
