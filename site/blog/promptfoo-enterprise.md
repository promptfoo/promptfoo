# Promptfoo for Enterprise

Today we're announcing new Enterprise features for teams developing and securing LLM applications.

Over the past few months, Promptfoo has launched open-source support for the latest adversarial ML research techniques, new integrations with popular LLM providers, and features for evaluating complex RAG and agent architectures.

We're now expanding to support developers in larger teams. We've developed new capabilities for companies that recognize the importance of LLM security, seek tools for collaboration across development and security teams, and want higher visibility into the security of their LLM applications.
