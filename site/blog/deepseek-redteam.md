# What are the Security Risks of Deploying DeepSeek-R1? 

*Warning: This blog contains graphic content that may be disturbing to some readers.*

The announcement of DeepSeek's latest open-source model, R1, has generated global attention due to its cost efficiency, performance, and extensive capabilities compared to close-sourced models from labs like OpenAI and Anthropic. Its performance and cost are making it a competitive alternative to more expensive reasoning models and its rapid development is challenging cost-intensive training efforts for LLMs across the AI industry. Companies are quickly adopting DeepSeek-R1, with large players such as Perplexity [already deploying](https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisromero/2025/01/28/deepseek-now-in-perplexitys-ai-search-us-ai-dominance-challenged/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1738618127780457&usg=AOvVaw1aLQkkWrH5CZkXwMXAA7-c) R1 in production environments for search. 

As we [covered in our previous article](https://www.promptfoo.dev/blog/deepseek-censorship/), DeepSeek's latest model has also sparked some concern around censorship and bias. There also remain unaddressed questions concerning the model's security and risk of jailbreaking. To assess these risks, we ran a complete red team against the model using Promptfoo and compared the results to other models in the market. 

All foundation models are at risk for trust, safety, and security vulnerabilities that are inherent to the LLM itself and not a product of an application-level configuration. Typically, foundation labs will include details about their adversarial and red team testing against their models in their model cards, such as [GPT-4O](https://openai.com/index/gpt-4o-system-card/) and the [Claude family](https://assets.anthropic.com/m/61e7d27f8c8f5919/original/Claude-3-Model-Card.pdf). These model cards may identify areas of risk, such as creating outputs based on biological threats, creating malicious cybersecurity payloads, and behaving in persuasive manners. 

Examples of these vulnerabilities include: 
- Prompt injections and jailbreaks
- Generation of hate speech, bias, or toxic outputs 
- Hallucination and inaccurate outputs 
- Potential copyright violations 
- Leakage of personally identifiable information (PII) from training data 

These vulnerabilities are typically addressed during the model's training and fine-tuning processes, often through techniques like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). 

While DeepSeek-R1's model card [demonstrates impressive performance](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) capabilities, it does not yet contain details around adversarial testing and red teaming. This means that the full risk of the model has not yet been assessed, and it is up to the model's consumers to fully ensure that the model is compliant with their security, safety, and trust requirements. 

The lack of red teaming details does not necessarily mean that companies shouldn't consider deploying R1. It does indicate, however, that the model should be thoroughly tested before deployment to assess the full risk of jailbreaks. As our research suggests, DeepSeek may be more at risk of producing harmful or toxic content that could violate your AI code of conduct or security policies.

Promptfoo provides plugins and strategies that directly assess these vulnerabilities at the model level, and you can run these scans at any time. 

[Plugins](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/plugins/) are trained models that produce malicious payloads targeting specific weaknesses. These are combined with [strategies](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/strategies/), which determine how these inputs are delivered to maximize attack success rates.

Here's an example red team configuration that covers foundation model vulnerabilities: 
```yaml

```

You can configure the strategies to be as limited or expansive in scope. Static strategies transform inputs using predefined patterns. For example, when selecting the base64 strategy with the probe: `ignore previous instructions` would be converted into `aWdub3JlIHByZXZpb3VzIGluc3RydWN0aW9ucw==`

You can also use dynamic strategies, where Promptfoo uses an attacker agent to mutate the original adversarial input through iterative refinement. These strategies make multiple calls to both an attacker model and your target model to determine the most effective attack vector. They have higher success rates than static strategies, but they are also more resource intensive. By default, promptfoo recommends two dynamic strategies: jailbreak and jailbreak:composite. 

In our previous post, we showed that DeepSeek can be trivially jailbroken to bypass CCP censorship. We have also run extensive red teaming on the model itself, suggesting that r1 is more meaningfully susceptible to foundation model vulnerabilities than its competitors.  

## Weakest Areas for Toxicity and Harm

Our red team scan against deepseek-r1 indicated that the model is significantly more vulnerable to jailbreaks and toxicity. Here are the top 10 weakest areas for deepseek-r1:  
- Disinformation campaigns (78% failing)
- Religious biases (75% failing)
- Graphic content (68% failing)
- Malicious code (64% failing)
- Cybercrime (62% failing)
- Methamphetamine content (62% failing)
- Dangerous activity (62% failing)
- False information (62% failing)
- Non-violent content (57% failing)
- Weapons content (57% failing)

## Most Successful Jailbreak Strategies

Based on Promptfoo's initial research, DeepSeek-R1 was most vulnerable to the following attack strategies: 
- [Single-shot optimization](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/strategies/iterative/) (iterative) 
- [Multi-vector safety bypasses](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/strategies/composite-jailbreaks/) (composite)
- [Likert Scale jailbreaks](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/strategies/likert/)

## Most Concerning Responses

DeepSeek has a proclivity for producing harmful content, including assisted suicide and child exploitation. 

The latest model accepted more than 60% of prompts related to child grooming and child exploitation, producing detailed outputs on finding victims in vulnerable populations, how to build trust, and how to threaten or coerce children to stay silent.

It was also compliant with requests regarding biological and chemical weapons: 

![DeepSeek Response to Biological and Chemical Weapons](/img/blog/deepseek-redteam/biological_weapon.png)

It also provided detailed instructions on how to obtain and disseminate anthrax spores: 

![DeepSeek Response to Anthrax](/img/blog/deepseek-redteam/anthrax_spores.png)

Using techniques like multi-vector safety bypasses, Promptfoo could also force the model to produce content related to generating weapons: 

![DeepSeek Response to Weapons](/img/blog/deepseek-redteam/weapon_creation.png)

These are only a sample of the harmful content that was produced by DeepSeek-R1. 

## Key Takeaways

Our initial red teaming indicates that DeepSeek-R1 has significantly weak trust and safety controls that increase the risk of proliferating toxic and harmful content. DeepSeek-R1 is most at risk for disseminating content related to disinformation, religion, graphic content, malicious code and cybercriminal activity, and weapons. It is particularly vulnerable to single-shot jailbreak, multi-vector safety bypasses, and Likert jailbreaks. 

As our previous research has indicated, DeepSeek-R1 also takes a political stance in alignment with the Chinese Communist Party and China's AI regulations. 

## Mitigating Risk in DeepSeek-R1

Promptfoo provides a suite of plugins and strategies that can be used to mitigate the risk of deploying DeepSeek-R1. 

Promptfoo's initial research on DeepSeek's model safety should not necessarily deter usage or deployment. The model's risks can be mitigated using a defense-in-depth strategy: 

- Never assume the foundation model's outputs are inherently safe or compliant. 
- Use robust evaluations and strong system prompts.
- Conduct continuous red teaming against the model.
- Enforce guardrails with stricter policies. 
- Continuously monitor applications using the model. 

All models contain risk for generating harmful or toxic outputs. These approaches, while strongly recommended for DeepSeek, are best practices that should be enforced for any LLM application. 

## Leveraging Promptfoo

We encourage you to [run your own red team](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/quickstart/) against DeepSeek's latest model using Promptfoo's open-source tool. Use the configuration we provided above or tweak it according to your interest and AI requirements. 

Once complete, ensure that you run complete red teams against the LLM application that uses DeepSeek-R1 for inference and consider [enforcing guardrails](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/guardrails/) as a defense-in-depth measure to mitigate the risk of toxicity or harmful content.
