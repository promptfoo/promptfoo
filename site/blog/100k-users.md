# Celebrating 100,000 Users: Promptfoo's Journey and the Shift to Red Teaming

We're thrilled to announce that Promptfoo now has over **100,000** users! This milestone is a testament to our incredible community of developers, enterprises, and AI enthusiasts who trust us to build secure and reliable AI applications.

Promptfoo was born out of a simple idea: prompt engineering should be systematic and measurable. Since our first open-source release in 2023, we've focused on giving developers the tools to evaluate prompts with confidence. Along the way, we discovered that testing wasn't enough—teams also needed a way to proactively identify vulnerabilities. That realization sparked our deeper investment in AI red teaming.

## How We Started

Promptfoo's founder Ian Webster began the project while leading AI engineering at Discord, where ensuring reliable model behavior was a daily challenge. Michael D'Angelo joined shortly after, bringing experience in scaling machine learning products. Together, they set out to create an open-source toolkit that removes guesswork from prompt engineering.

## The Shift to Red Teaming

As the ecosystem matured, users asked for more than just evaluation. They wanted to know how their prompts would hold up against adversarial attacks. Today, red teaming is a cornerstone of Promptfoo. Our framework simulates malicious inputs—prompt injections, toxic content, and more—so that teams can fix weaknesses before they ship.

Red teaming matters because it elevates AI security beyond basic testing. By anticipating how a model might be exploited, developers can build applications that stand up to real-world threats.

## Embracing AI Agents and Multi-Agent Systems

The AI landscape continues to evolve rapidly, with new paradigms emerging. Recently, we've witnessed a significant shift toward AI agents and multi-agent systems—autonomous models capable of performing complex, multi-step tasks. Recognizing this shift, Promptfoo expanded its capabilities to support agentic systems, empowering developers to evaluate and secure these advanced applications effectively.

Promptfoo now provides specialized tools to simulate and test multi-agent interactions, ensuring coherent and safe agent behavior across various tasks and environments. Our comprehensive evaluation metrics help developers verify that agents perform intended actions without unintended consequences, maintaining safety, reliability, and consistency.

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

To better support the evolving ecosystem, we've introduced Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP provides a structured way to manage and communicate context, evaluation criteria, and security requirements across different AI systems and environments. It enhances collaboration, consistency, and efficiency, enabling teams to integrate advanced testing and red teaming seamlessly into their workflows.

MCP is particularly valuable in complex deployments involving multiple models, agents, or integrated systems, as it streamlines communication and ensures that security checks and evaluations remain aligned and comprehensive.

## Where We Stand Today

Promptfoo is now trusted by individual developers, startups, and over two dozen Fortune 500 companies. Our users rely on Promptfoo to:

- Test prompts across multiple LLM providers.
- Perform red teaming to detect vulnerabilities.
- Benchmark models and track quality metrics.
- Integrate AI security testing into CI/CD pipelines.

This growth has been fueled by an active open-source community, regular releases, and educational collaborations with organizations like OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS, and IBM.

## Looking Ahead

Reaching 100,000 users is just the beginning. Here's what's next for Promptfoo:

- **Democratizing advanced AI security.** We're working to make red teaming techniques accessible to every builder.
- **Enhanced agent and multi-agent testing capabilities.** Expect deeper support for simulating complex agent interactions and security scenarios.
- **Next-gen user experience.** Expect more automation around vulnerability detection and a richer analytics dashboard.
- **Expanding coverage.** As new models and modalities appear, Promptfoo will continue to support them so your applications stay protected.
