## Black Hat AI Summit (Tentative): Tuesday, August 5

Join us at the Black Hat pre-conference summit to watch us auto-red-team GPT-4 in under 30 seconds. You'll see how Fortune 500 companies catch [LLM vulnerabilities](/blog/llm-security-checklist) before production, because nobody wants their chatbot on the evening news.

- **When**: Tuesday, August 5, 2025, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- **Where**: Mandalay Bay Convention Center, Las Vegas
- **What to expect**: Live vulnerability discovery across 15+ attack vectors

## Black Hat Business Hall: August 6-7

Find us at booth #4712 in the AI Zone Pavilion. We'll be running live demos every 30 minutes, showing how [our open-source scanner](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo) catches the sneaky stuff that manual testing misses.

### CEO Talk: Breaking and Fixing LLMs at Scale

Hear from our co-founder and CEO Michael D'Angelo about deploying secure LLMs when your threat model includes "literally everyone on the internet."

**Schedule**:

- Wednesday, August 6: 2:30 PM - 6:00 PM
- Thursday, August 7: 10:00 AM - 1:00 PM
- **Location**: Business Hall, Arsenal Lab Station 1

Pro tip: Bring your nastiest prompts. We'll test them live.

## DEF CON 33 Exhibitor Booth: August 8-10

Find us at the Las Vegas Convention Center, somewhere between the lock-picking village and whoever's running Doom on a pregnancy test this year. Look for the red panda mascot with trust issues.

Stop by for:

- Live demos of [agent security testing](/blog/agent-security)
- Limited edition "My LLM Got Pwned at DEF CON" shirts

## FAQ

### What is Promptfoo?

Promptfoo is an open-source LLM security scanner that automatically finds vulnerabilities in AI applications. Think of it as Burp Suite for prompts, but with better memes.

### Where can I find you at Black Hat?

Booth #4712 in the AI Zone Pavilion. We're the ones with the paranoid red panda mascot and a suspicious amount of energy drinks.

### Do I need to pay for demos?

Nope! All demos are free. The only cost is listening to our engineers explain why your prompts aren't as secure as you think.

### What should I bring to your booth?

Your worst prompts, your best questions, and a healthy skepticism about AI security claims.
