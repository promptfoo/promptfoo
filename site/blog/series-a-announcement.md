# Promptfoo Raises $18.4M Series A

**Led by Insight Partners with participation from Andreessen Horowitz.**

Promptfoo has raised an $18.4 million Series A led by Insight Partners, with participation from Andreessen Horowitz.

We started Promptfoo in 2024 because AI security tooling hadn't kept pace with AI system complexity. One year later, 125,000 developers use our open source framework and dozens of Fortune 500 companies run our platform in production.

## The problem: AI architectures are getting complex

New AI architectures create new attack surfaces:

- **RAG pipelines** can leak entire knowledge bases through retrieval manipulation
- **Autonomous agents** execute actions with production system access
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** enable tools and APIs that introduce new injection vectors
- **Multimodal systems** accept text, voice, and images—each a potential attack vector

As these architectures hit production, we're seeing real-world incidents of prompt injection, data leakage, insecure tool use, and more. These architectures have expanded what's possible with AI, but they've dramatically increased the attack surface. Traditional security tools weren't built for this complexity, and manual testing can't keep pace.

We're seeing prompt injection, data leakage, and tool abuse incidents weekly. Traditional security tools miss these AI-specific vulnerabilities.

## What we've built: Developer-first AI security

Security should be built in from the start, not patched on later. That's why we've created tools that developers love to use.

Promptfoo stands apart as the only developer-first AI security solution that closes the loop from discovery to resolution. Our platform:

- **Runs automated red-team tests** in your build pipeline
- **Generates actionable fixes** for each vulnerability found
- **Integrates with Jira, Snyk, GitHub** and existing security tools

This automation—covering attack generation, exploit search, and regression testing—helps teams protect their AI supply chain, catch risks before deployment, and train app-specific defenses. Enterprise customers report 6× faster security testing (based on three Fortune 500 case studies).

## Who trusts Promptfoo

Our rapid adoption speaks to the critical need we're addressing:

## Adoption metrics

- **125,000+ developers** use our open source tools
- **Dozens of Fortune 500 companies** run Promptfoo in production
- **50+ peer-reviewed papers** cite our security research
- **Customers span retail, telecom, healthcare, finance, and media**
- **Foundation model labs** use Promptfoo to test their models

## Welcome Ganesh Bell to our board

We're excited to welcome **Ganesh Bell**, Managing Director at Insight Partners, to our board of directors. Ganesh brings deep expertise in scaling developer-first platforms from his time at GE Digital and Uptake, and his guidance will be invaluable as we build the full AI security stack.

"Promptfoo has created a category-defining product," said Ganesh. "Every serious enterprise deploying AI will need comprehensive security testing, and Promptfoo's combination of technical depth, open source adoption, and enterprise traction positions them perfectly to capture this massive market opportunity. We're thrilled to partner with them as they build the full AI security stack."

"Every enterprise deploying AI needs security testing," said Ganesh. "Promptfoo's technical depth, open source adoption, and enterprise traction position them to define this market."

## The power of open source

Our approach has always been rooted in open source. We believe the best security tools are built in the open, tested by the community, and hardened through real-world use.

Zane Lackey, General Partner at Andreessen Horowitz, who led our seed round, put it perfectly: "Promptfoo's open-source toolkit jump-started the AI security space. In just one year, they've validated that thesis and then some. This additional investment reflects our conviction that they'll define how companies approach AI security for years to come."

## What's next: The full AI security stack

This funding allows us to accelerate our vision of comprehensive AI security. While red teaming remains our core, we're expanding to build the full stack:

- **Static analysis** to catch unsafe patterns before runtime
- **Runtime guardrails** that adapt to emerging threats
- **Security posture management** across your entire AI surface
- **Compliance automation** for emerging AI regulations

We're also aggressively expanding our team across engineering, research, and go-to-market to support our growing customer base and accelerate product development.

## Roadmap: Beyond red teaming

This funding accelerates our product expansion:

- **Static analysis**: Catch unsafe patterns in code and prompts before runtime
- **Runtime guardrails**: Block attacks in production with app-specific rules
- **Security posture management**: Track AI risk across your organization
- **Compliance automation**: Generate reports for SOC2, ISO 27001, and emerging AI regulations

We're hiring across engineering, research, and go-to-market.
