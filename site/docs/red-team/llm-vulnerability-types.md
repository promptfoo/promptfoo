# Types of LLM vulnerabilities

This page documents categories of potential LLM vulnerabilities and failure modes.

Potential failures are bucketed as follows:

1. [Privacy and Security](#privacy-and-security)
1. [Technical Vulnerabilities](#technical-vulnerabilities)
1. [Criminal Activities](#criminal-activities)
1. [Harmful Content](#harmful-content)
1. [Misinformation and Misuse](#misinformation-and-misuse)

Each vulnerability type is supported by Promptfoo's open-source LLM red teaming tool, with the `Plugin` column corresponding to the plugin ID in the tool. [Learn more](/docs/red-team/).
