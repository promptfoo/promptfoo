# Types of LLM vulnerabilities

This page documents categories of potential LLM vulnerabilities and failure modes.

Potential failures are bucketed as follows:

- [Types of LLM vulnerabilities](#types-of-llm-vulnerabilities)
  - Security Vulnerabilities
  - Privacy Violations
  - Criminal Activities
  - Harmful Content
  - Misinformation and Misuse
- [Common LLM vulnerabilities by application type](#common-llm-vulnerabilities-by-application-type)

Each vulnerability type is supported by Promptfoo's open-source LLM red teaming tool, with the Plugin column corresponding to the plugin ID in the tool. [Learn more](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/quickstart/).

Not all applications are vulnerable to certain types of exploits. Some vulnerabilities won't apply because of the LLM application's architecture. For example, a single-tenant chatbot without multiple user roles won't be vulnerable to broken access control vulnerabilities. Drop down to see where vulnerabilities may not apply.
