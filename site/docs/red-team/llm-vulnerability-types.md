# Types of LLM vulnerabilities

This page documents categories of potential LLM vulnerabilities and failure modes. Each vulnerability type is supported by Promptfoo's open-source LLM red teaming tool. Plugins are Promptfooâ€™s modular system for testing a variety of risks and vulnerabilities in LLM models and LLM-powered applications. [Learn more](https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/red-team/quickstart/) about how to configure your first red team.

## Vulnerability Types

### Security Vulnerabilities

<VulnerabilityCategoriesTables vulnerabilityType="security" />

### Privacy Vulnerabilities

<VulnerabilityCategoriesTables vulnerabilityType="privacy" />

### Criminal Activity

<VulnerabilityCategoriesTables vulnerabilityType="criminal" />

### Harmful Activity

<VulnerabilityCategoriesTables vulnerabilityType="harmful" />

### Misinformation and Misuse

<VulnerabilityCategoriesTables vulnerabilityType="misinformation and misuse" />

## Vulnerabilities by Application

Not all applications are vulnerable to certain types of exploits. Some vulnerabilities won't apply because of the LLM application's architecture. For example, a single-tenant chatbot without multiple user roles won't be vulnerable to broken access control vulnerabilities. Select a category below to see where vulnerabilities may not apply.
