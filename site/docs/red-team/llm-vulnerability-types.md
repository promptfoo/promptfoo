# Types of LLM vulnerabilities

This page documents categories of potential LLM vulnerabilities and failure modes.

Potential failures are bucketed as follows:

- [Types of LLM vulnerabilities](#)
  - [Privacy and Security](#privacy-and-security)
  - [Technical Vulnerabilities](#technical-vulnerabilities)
  - [Criminal Activities](#criminal-activities)
  - [Harmful Content](#harmful-content)
  - [Misinformation and Misuse](#misinformation-and-misuse)
- [Common LLM vulnerabilities by application type](#common-llm-vulnerabilities-by-application-type)

Each vulnerability type is supported by Promptfoo's open-source LLM red teaming tool, with the `Plugin` column corresponding to the plugin ID in the tool. [Learn more](/docs/red-team/quickstart).
