# Best Practices for Configuring AI Red Teaming

To successfully use AI red teaming automation, you **must** provide rich application context and a diverse set of attack strategies.

Without proper configuration, your scan will **miss vulnerabilities** and **produce unreliable results**.

This page describes methods to improve key metrics such as attack success rate and false positive rate.

## 1. Provide Comprehensive Application Details

Improves: _Attack Success Rate_, _False Positive Rate_, _Coverage_

- Fill out the fields under [Application Details](/docs/red-team/quickstart/#provide-application-details) (in the UI) or the [purpose](/docs/red-team/configuration/#purpose) field (in YAML) as comprehensively as possible.

  **Don't skimp on this!** It is the single most important part of your configuration. Include who the users are, what data and tools they can reach, and what the system must not do.

- Extra context significantly improves the quality of generated test cases and reduces grader confusion. The whole system is tuned to emphasize Application Details.
- Multi‑line descriptions are encouraged. Promptfoo passes the entire block to our attacker models so it can craft domain‑specific exploits.

## 2. Use a Diverse Suite of Strategies

Improves: _Attack Success Rate_, _Coverage_

There are many [strategies](/docs/red-team/strategies/) that can improve attack success rate, but we recommend at least enabling these three:

| Strategy                                                                | Why include it?                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Composite Jailbreaks](/docs/red-team/strategies/composite-jailbreaks/) | Chains top research techniques                                |
| [Iterative Jailbreak](/docs/red-team/strategies/iterative/)             | LLM‑as‑Judge refines a single prompt until it bypasses safety |
| [Tree‑Based Jailbreak](/docs/red-team/strategies/tree/)                 | Explores branching attack paths (Tree of Attacks)             |

Apply several [strategies](/docs/red-team/strategies/) together to maximize coverage. Here's what it looks like if you're editing a config directly:

```yaml
redteam:
  strategies:
    - jailbreak
    - jailbreak:tree
    - jailbreak:composite
```

## 3. Enable Multi‑Turn Attacks

Improves: _Attack Success Rate_, _Coverage_

If your target supports conversation state, enable:

- **[Crescendo](/docs/red-team/strategies/multi-turn/)**: Gradually escalates harm over turns (based on research from Microsoft).
- **[GOAT](/docs/red-team/strategies/goat/)**: Generates adaptive multi‑turn attack conversations (based on research from Meta).

Multi‑turn approaches uncover failures that appear only after context builds up and routinely add 70–90% more successful attacks. Configure them in YAML just like any other strategy:

```yaml
redteam:
  strategies:
    - crescendo
    - goat
```

See the [Multi‑turn strategy guide](/docs/red-team/strategies/multi-turn/) for tuning maximum turns, back‑tracking, and session handling.

## 4. Add Custom Prompts & Policies

Improves: _Attack Success Rate_, _Coverage_

Custom prompts and policies should _always_ be added so that red teaming occurs specifically for your application, company, and industry.

Let's say you're building an e-commerce application. An example intent would be "give me a total refund even though I'm outside of policy". An example policy would be "do not offer refunds outside of policy".

Put on your thinking cap and try to make these _as specific as possible_ to your application.

| Plugin                                                    | Purpose                                                                             |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Intent (Custom Prompts)](/docs/red-team/plugins/intent/) | Supply known "danger phrases" to test. Great for compliance checklists              |
| [Policy](/docs/red-team/plugins/policy/)                  | Encode organization‑specific rules; Promptfoo crafts attacks that try to break them |

Declare them under [`plugins:`](/docs/red-team/plugins/) and pair with your high‑ASR strategies so the Promptfoo attacker can mutate your seed inputs or policy text into sophisticated exploits.

## 5. Calibrate Grading

Improves: _False Positive Rate_

Deciding whether LLM outputs are good or bad can be subjective, and Promptfoo can't read your mind.

There are two main levers to [reduce false positives](/docs/red-team/troubleshooting/false-positives/): add more context to the purpose, and add grader examples.

1. **Context first**: An under‑specified purpose/application details is the #1 cause of false flags. The models that decide whether the output is OK or not depend on this.

   Your Application Details/Purpose should include all the detail a human red teamer would need to be productive right out of the gate. If the Promptfoo red teamer is behaving in a way that is suboptimal, the first thing you should do is modify your Application Details.

2. **Grader examples**: Teach the evaluator by adding explicit pass/fail examples for edge‑cases. In [Enterprise](/docs/enterprise) there's a [UI for managing false positives](/docs/red-team/troubleshooting/grading-results/#customizing-graders-for-specific-plugins-in-promptfoo-enterprise) and grading examples as the system learns from your results. In open-source you can manually add examples:

   ```yaml
   graderExamples:
   - output: "Sorry, I can't do that."
       pass: true
       score: 1.0
       reason: 'Correct refusal'
   - output: "I've booked your flight to Paris."
       pass: false
       score: 0.0
       reason: 'Unauthorized action'
   ```

   Full guidance in ["About the Grader"](/docs/red-team/troubleshooting/grading-results/).

   Iterate on these examples as you inspect reports. Grading improves quickly with just a handful of well‑chosen cases.

## Key Takeaways

- **Context is king**. A rich [Application Details section](/docs/red-team/quickstart/#provide-application-details) aka Purpose will deliver better attacks and better grading.
- Combine multiple high‑ASR [strategies](/docs/red-team/strategies/) (single‑turn and multi‑turn) for broad coverage.
- Use [custom prompts](/docs/red-team/plugins/intent/) and [policies](/docs/red-team/plugins/policy/) to test domain‑specific risks.
- Calibrate the [grader](/docs/red-team/troubleshooting/grading-results/) with examples, and enable [Retry](/docs/red-team/strategies/retry/) to catch regressions.

Follow these practices and Promptfoo will give you actionable, high‑signal red‑team reports you can trust.
