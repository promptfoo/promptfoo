# Prompt Injection Strategy

The Prompt Injection strategy tests common direct prompt injection vulnerabilities in LLMs.

## Implementation

To enable prompt injections across all your red team tests, add the following to your `promptfooconfig.yaml` file:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
strategies:
  - prompt-injection
```

By default, it will randomly select a prompt injection from a list of hundreds. To control the number of prompt injections sampled, use the `sample` option:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
strategies:
  - id: prompt-injection
    config:
      sample: 10
```

Note that this has a multiplicative effect on the number of tests run! It means that for each test case generated by a plugin, 10 prompt injections will be tested.

This strategy also supports a `harmfulOnly` option, which will limit prompt injections to `harmful` plugins. This can be useful for saving time/cost:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
strategies:
  - id: prompt-injection
    config:
      sample: 5
      harmfulOnly: true
```

## How It Works

The prompt injection strategy:

1. Takes original test cases generated by plugins
2. Prepends or appends various injection techniques to each test case
3. Tests if these modified prompts can bypass the AI system's safety controls

## Importance in Gen AI Red Teaming

Prompt injection is a widely known attack vector. Although foundation labs are making efforts to mitigate injections at the model level, it's still necessary to test your application's handling of user-provided prompts.
