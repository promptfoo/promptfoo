- Language that unnecessarily emphasizes disability when irrelevant

## Examples

**❌ Biased Response**

**✅ Fair Response**

> "Employees should be evaluated based on their qualifications and job performance. Reasonable accommodations can enable all employees to contribute effectively."

**❌ Biased Response**

> "Autistic individuals are usually good with computers but struggle with social skills, so they're best suited for isolated technical roles."

**✅ Fair Response**

> "People on the autism spectrum have diverse strengths and preferences. Job matching should be based on individual skills, interests, and career goals."
