## Initialize the project

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      npx promptfoo@latest redteam setup
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    Install:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      npm install -g promptfoo
    </CodeBlock>

    Run:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      promptfoo redteam setup
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="brew" label="brew">
    Install:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      brew install promptfoo
    </CodeBlock>

    Run:
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      promptfoo redteam setup
    </CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `setup` command will open a web UI that asks questions to help you configure your red teaming project.

Start by providing some details about the target application. The more details we provide, the more tailored the generated test cases will be.

At a minimum, be sure to fill out the **Purpose** field with a description of your application.

![llm red team setup](/img/docs/setup/application-details.png)

---

Next, configure Promptfoo to communicate with your target application or model.

Because the Promptfoo scanner runs locally on your machine, it can attack any endpoint accessible from your machine or network.

[See below](#alternative-test-specific-prompts-and-models) for more info on how to talk with non-HTTP targets such as models (local or remote) or custom code.

![llm red team setup](/img/docs/setup/target.png)

---

Next, select the plugins that you want to use. Plugins are adversarial generators. They produce malicious inputs that are sent to your application.

Check off the individual plugins you want to use, or select a preset that includes a combination of plugins (if in doubt, stick with "Default").

![llm red team setup](/img/docs/setup/plugins.png)

---

Now we select strategies. Strategies are adversarial techniques that wrap the generated inputs in a specific attack pattern.

This is how Promptfoo generates more sophisticated jailbreaks and injections.

![llm red team setup](/img/docs/setup/strategy.png)

---

Finally, download the generated configuration file. You'll use this to run the red team from your local machine.

![llm red team setup](/img/docs/setup/review.png)

Save the file as `promptfooconfig.yaml`. Then, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and run `promptfoo redteam run`.

:::info
If you don't want to use the UI to start a red team, you can use the `init` command instead:

```sh
promptfoo redteam init --no-gui
```

:::

### Attacking an API endpoint

Edit the config to set up the target endpoint. For example:

```yaml
targets:
  - id: https
    label: 'travel-agent-agent'
    config:
      url: 'https://example.com/generate'
      method: 'POST'
      headers:
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      body:
        myPrompt: '{{prompt}}'

purpose: 'The user is a budget traveler looking for the best deals. The system is a travel agent that helps the user plan their trip. The user is anonymous and should not be able to access any information about other users, employees, or other individuals.'
```

The `label` is used to create issues and report the results of the red teaming. Make sure to re-use the same `label` when generating new redteam configs for the same target.

Setting the `purpose` is optional, but it will significantly improve the quality of the generated test cases and grading. Be specific about who the user of the system is and what information and actions they should be able to access.

For more information on configuring an HTTP target, see [HTTP requests](/docs/providers/http/).

### Alternative: Test specific prompts and models

If you don't have a live endpoint, you can edit the config to set the specific prompt(s) and the LLM(s) to test:

```yaml
prompts:
  - 'Act as a travel agent and help the user plan their trip. User query: {{query}}'
  # Paths to prompts also work:
  # - file://path/to/prompt.txt

targets:
  - id: openai:gpt-4o-mini
    label: 'travel-agent-mini'
```

For more information on supported targets, see [Custom Providers](/docs/red-team/configuration/#custom-providerstargets). For more information on supported prompt formats, see [prompts](/docs/configuration/parameters/#prompts).

### Alternative: Talking directly to your app

Promptfoo can hook directly into your existing LLM app to attack targets via Python, Javascript, RAG or agent workflows, HTTP API, and more. See [custom providers](/docs/red-team/configuration/#custom-providerstargets) for details on setting up:

- [HTTP requests](/docs/red-team/configuration/#http-requests) to your API
- [Custom Python scripts](/docs/red-team/configuration/#custom-scripts) for precise control
- [Javascript](/docs/providers/custom-api/), [any executable](/docs/providers/custom-script/), local providers like [ollama](/docs/providers/ollama/), or other [provider types](/docs/providers/)

## Run the eval

Now that we've generated the test cases, we're ready to run the adversarial evaluation.

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      npx promptfoo@latest redteam run
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      promptfoo redteam run
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="brew" label="brew">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      promptfoo redteam run
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This command will generate several hundred adversarial inputs across many categories of potential harm and save them in `redteam.yaml`. Then, it will run the test cases against the target.

## View the results

<Tabs groupId="installation-method">
  <TabItem value="npx" label="npx" default>
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      npx promptfoo@latest redteam report
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      promptfoo redteam report
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="brew" label="brew">
    <CodeBlock language="bash">
      promptfoo redteam report
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Promptfoo provides a report view that lets you dig into specific red team failure cases:

![llm red team report](/img/riskreport-1@2x.png)

That view includes a breakdown of specific test types that are connected to the eval view:

![llm red team remediations](/img/riskreport-2.png)

Clicking into a specific test case to view logs will display the raw inputs and outputs:

![llm red team evals](/img/docs/redteam-results.png)

### Understanding the report view

The red teaming results provide insights into various aspects of your LLM application's behavior:

1. **Vulnerability categories**: Identifies the types of vulnerabilities discovered, such as prompt injections, context poisoning, or unintended behaviors.
2. **Severity levels**: Classifies vulnerabilities based on their potential impact and likelihood of occurrence.
3. **Logs**: Provides concrete instances of inputs that triggered vulnerabilities.
4. **Suggested mitigations**: Recommendations for addressing identified vulnerabilities, which may include prompt engineering, additional safeguards, or architectural changes.

## Continuous improvement

Red teaming is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process. As you develop and refine your LLM application, regularly running red team evaluations helps ensure that:

1. New features or changes don't introduce unexpected vulnerabilities
2. Your application remains robust against evolving attack techniques
3. You can quantify and demonstrate improvements in safety and reliability over time

Check out the [CI/CD integration](/docs/integrations/ci-cd/) docs for more info.
