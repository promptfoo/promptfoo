# F5

[F5](https://f5.ai/) provides an interface for a handful of LLM APIs.

The F5 provider is compatible with all the options provided by the [OpenAI provider](/docs/providers/openai/).

In the F5 AI Gateway, you can create paths that serve OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Here's an example:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: f5:path-name
    config:
      temperature: 0.5
      apiBaseUrl: https://path.to.f5.ai/
      apiKey: YOUR_F5_API_KEY
```

If you prefer to use an environment variable, set `F5_API_KEY`.

For more information on the available models and API usage, refer to the F5 documentation for each specific model.
