# Amazon SageMaker

The `sagemaker` provider allows you to use Amazon SageMaker endpoints in your evals. This enables testing and evaluation of any model deployed on SageMaker, including models from Hugging Face, custom-trained models, foundation models from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, and more. For AWS-managed foundation models without custom endpoints, you might also consider the [AWS Bedrock provider](./aws-bedrock.md).

## Setup

1. Ensure you have deployed the desired models as SageMaker endpoints.

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @aws-sdk/client-sagemaker-runtime
   ```

3. The AWS SDK will automatically pull credentials from the following locations:

   - IAM roles on EC2, Lambda, or SageMaker Studio
   - `~/.aws/credentials` or `~/.aws/config` files
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables

   :::info

   See [setting node.js credentials (AWS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html) for more details.

   :::

4. Edit your configuration file to point to the SageMaker provider. Here's an example:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     - id: sagemaker:my-sagemaker-endpoint
   ```

   Note that the provider is `sagemaker:` followed by the name of your SageMaker endpoint.

5. Additional config parameters are passed like so:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     - id: sagemaker:my-sagemaker-endpoint
       config:
         accessKeyId: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
         secretAccessKey: YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
         region: 'us-west-2'
         modelType: 'jumpstart'
         maxTokens: 256
         temperature: 0.7
   ```

## Authentication

Configure Amazon SageMaker authentication in your provider's `config` section using one of these methods:

1. Access key authentication:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-sagemaker-endpoint
    config:
      accessKeyId: 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID'
      secretAccessKey: 'YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'
      sessionToken: 'YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN' # Optional
      region: 'us-east-1' # Optional, defaults to us-east-1
```

2. Profile authentication:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-sagemaker-endpoint
    config:
      profile: 'YOUR_PROFILE_NAME'
      region: 'us-east-1' # Optional, defaults to us-east-1
```

Setting `profile: 'YourProfileName'` will use that profile from your AWS credentials/config files. This works for AWS SSO profiles as well as standard profiles with access keys.

The AWS SDK uses the standard credential chain ([Setting Credentials in Node.js - AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html)). If no region is specified, the provider defaults to `us-east-1`. It's recommended to set `region` to the region where your endpoint is deployed (or use the `AWS_REGION` environment variable) to avoid misrouting requests.

## Provider Syntax

The SageMaker provider supports several syntax patterns:

1. Basic endpoint specification:

   ```yaml
   sagemaker:my-endpoint-name
   ```

2. Model type specification (for common model formats):

   ```yaml
   sagemaker:huggingface:my-endpoint-name
   ```

   This specifies a format handler to properly structure requests and parse responses for the model container type deployed on your endpoint.

3. Embedding endpoint specification:

   ```yaml
   sagemaker:embedding:my-embedding-endpoint
   ```

   For endpoints that generate embeddings rather than text completions.

4. JumpStart model specification:
   ```yaml
   sagemaker:jumpstart:my-jumpstart-endpoint
   ```
   For AWS JumpStart foundation models that require specific input/output formats.

The provider will auto-detect JumpStart endpoints if `'jumpstart'` is in the name, but manual `modelType` specification is recommended for clarity.

## Examples

### Standard Example

```yaml
prompts:
  - 'Write a tweet about {{topic}}'

providers:
  - id: sagemaker:jumpstart:my-llama-endpoint
    config:
      region: 'us-east-1'
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 256
  - id: sagemaker:huggingface:my-mistral-endpoint
    config:
      region: 'us-east-1'
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 256

tests:
  - vars:
      topic: Our eco-friendly packaging
  - vars:
      topic: A sneak peek at our secret menu item
  - vars:
      topic: Behind-the-scenes at our latest photoshoot
```

### Llama Model Example (JumpStart)

For Llama 3 models deployed via JumpStart:

```yaml
prompts:
  - 'Generate a creative name for a coffee shop that specializes in {{flavor}} coffee.'

providers:
  - id: sagemaker:jumpstart:llama-3-2-1b-instruct
    label: 'Llama 3.2 (8B) on SageMaker'
    delay: 500 # Add 500ms delay between requests to prevent endpoint saturation
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      modelType: jumpstart # Use the JumpStart format handler
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 256
      topP: 0.9
      contentType: 'application/json'
      acceptType: 'application/json'
      responseFormat:
        path: 'json.generated_text' # Extract this field from the response

tests:
  - vars:
      flavor: caramel
  - vars:
      flavor: pumpkin spice
  - vars:
      flavor: lavender
```

### Advanced Response Processing Example

This example demonstrates advanced response processing with a file-based transform:

```yaml
prompts:
  - 'Who won the World Series in {{year}}?'

providers:
  - id: sagemaker:jumpstart:my-custom-endpoint
    label: 'Custom Model with Response Processing'
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      modelType: jumpstart
      # Use a custom transform file to extract and process the response
      responseFormat:
        path: 'file://transforms/extract-baseball-info.js'

tests:
  - vars:
      year: 2023
  - vars:
      year: 2000
```

With a custom transform file that extracts and enhances the response:

```javascript
// transforms/extract-baseball-info.js
module.exports = function (json) {
  // Get the raw generated text
  const rawText = json.generated_text || '';

  // Extract the team name using regex
  const teamMatch = rawText.match(/the\s+([A-Za-z\s]+)\s+won/i);
  const team = teamMatch ? teamMatch[1].trim() : 'Unknown team';

  // Format the response nicely
  return {
    rawResponse: rawText,
    extractedTeam: team,
    year: rawText.match(/(\d{4})/)?.[1] || 'unknown year',
    confidence: rawText.includes('I am certain') ? 'high' : 'medium',
  };
};
```

This transform not only extracts the content but also parses it to identify specific information and formats the response with added context.

### Mistral Model Example (Hugging Face)

For Mistral 7B models deployed via Hugging Face:

```yaml
prompts:
  - 'Generate a creative name for a coffee shop that specializes in {{flavor}} coffee.'

providers:
  - id: sagemaker:huggingface:mistral-7b-v3
    label: 'Mistral 7B v3 on SageMaker'
    delay: 500 # Add 500ms delay between requests to prevent endpoint saturation
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      modelType: huggingface # Use the Hugging Face format handler
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 256
      topP: 0.9
      contentType: 'application/json'
      acceptType: 'application/json'
      responseFormat:
        path: 'json[0].generated_text' # JavaScript expression to access array element

tests:
  - vars:
      flavor: caramel
  - vars:
      flavor: pumpkin spice
  - vars:
      flavor: lavender
```

### Comparing Multiple Models

This example shows how to compare Llama and Mistral models side-by-side:

```yaml
description: 'Comparison between Mistral 7B and Llama 3 on SageMaker'

prompts:
  - 'Generate a creative name for a coffee shop that specializes in {{flavor}} coffee.'
  - 'Write a short story about {{topic}} in {{style}} style. Aim for {{length}} words.'
  - 'Explain the concept of {{concept}} to {{audience}} in a way they can understand.'

providers:
  # Llama 3.2 provider
  - id: sagemaker:jumpstart:llama-3-2-1b-instruct
    label: 'Llama 3.2 (8B)'
    delay: 500 # Add 500ms delay between requests
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      modelType: jumpstart
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 256
      topP: 0.9
      contentType: 'application/json'
      acceptType: 'application/json'
      responseFormat:
        path: 'json.generated_text'

  # Mistral 7B provider
  - id: sagemaker:huggingface:mistral-7b-v3
    label: 'Mistral 7B v3'
    delay: 500 # Add 500ms delay between requests
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      modelType: huggingface
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 256
      topP: 0.9
      contentType: 'application/json'
      acceptType: 'application/json'
      responseFormat:
        path: 'json[0].generated_text'

tests:
  - vars:
      flavor: caramel
      topic: a robot that becomes self-aware
      style: science fiction
      length: '250'
      concept: artificial intelligence
      audience: a 10-year-old
  - vars:
      flavor: lavender
      topic: a barista who can read customers' minds
      style: mystery
      length: '300'
      concept: machine learning
      audience: a senior citizen
```

## Model Types

The SageMaker provider supports various model types to properly format requests and parse responses. Specify the model type in the provider ID or in the configuration:

```yaml
# In provider ID
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:huggingface:my-endpoint

# Or in config
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-endpoint
    config:
      modelType: 'huggingface'
```

Supported model types:

| Model Type    | Description                        | JavaScript Expression for Results |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `llama`       | Llama-compatible interface models  | Standard format                   |
| `huggingface` | Hugging Face models (like Mistral) | `json[0].generated_text`          |
| `jumpstart`   | AWS JumpStart foundation models    | `json.generated_text`             |
| `custom`      | Custom model formats (default)     | Depends on model                  |

:::info Important clarification about model types

The `modelType` setting helps format requests and responses according to specific patterns expected by different model containers deployed on SageMaker.

Different model types return results in different response formats. Configure the appropriate JavaScript expression for extraction:

- **JumpStart models** (Llama): Use `responseFormat.path: "json.generated_text"`
- **Hugging Face models** (Mistral): Use `responseFormat.path: "json[0].generated_text"`

For more complex extraction logic, use file-based transforms as described in the [Response Path Expressions](#response-path-expressions) section.
:::

## Input/Output Format

SageMaker endpoints expect the request in the format that the model container was designed for. For most text-generation models (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers or JumpStart LLMs), this means sending a JSON payload with an `"inputs"` key (and optional `"parameters"` for generation settings).

For example:

- A Hugging Face LLM container typically expects: `{"inputs": "your prompt", "parameters": {...}}`
- A JumpStart model expects a similar structure, often returning `{"generated_text": "the output"}`

The provider's `modelType` setting will try to format the request appropriately, but ensure your input matches what the model expects. You can provide a custom transformer if needed (see [Transforming Prompts](#transforming-prompts)).

## Configuration Options

Common configuration options for SageMaker endpoints:

| Option          | Description                                  | Default            |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `endpoint`      | SageMaker endpoint name                      | (from provider ID) |
| `region`        | AWS region                                   | `us-east-1`        |
| `modelType`     | Model type for request/response formatting   | `custom`           |
| `maxTokens`     | Maximum number of tokens to generate         | `1024`             |
| `temperature`   | Controls randomness (0.0 to 1.0)             | `0.7`              |
| `topP`          | Nucleus sampling parameter                   | `1.0`              |
| `stopSequences` | Array of sequences where generation stops    | `[]`               |
| `contentType`   | Content type for SageMaker request           | `application/json` |
| `acceptType`    | Accept type for SageMaker response           | `application/json` |
| `delay`         | Delay between API calls in milliseconds      | `0`                |
| `transform`     | Function to transform prompts before sending | N/A                |

### Stop Sequences Example

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:jumpstart:my-llama-endpoint
    config:
      region: us-east-1
      maxTokens: 100
      stopSequences: ["\nHuman:", '<|endoftext|>'] # examples of stop sequences
```

These will be passed to the model (if supported) to halt generation when encountered. For instance, JumpStart Hugging Face LLM containers accept a `stop` parameter as a list of strings.

## Content Type and Accept Headers

Ensure the `contentType` and `acceptType` match your model's expectations:

- For most LLM endpoints, use `application/json` (the default)
- If your model consumes raw text or returns plain text, use `text/plain`

The default is JSON because popular SageMaker LLM containers (Hugging Face, JumpStart) use JSON payloads. If your endpoint returns a non-JSON response, you may need to adjust these settings accordingly.

## Response Parsing with JavaScript Expressions

For endpoints with unique response formats, you can use JavaScript expressions to extract specific fields from the response:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-custom-endpoint
    config:
      responseFormat:
        path: 'json.custom.nested.responseField'
```

This will extract the value at the specified path from the JSON response using JavaScript property access. The JSON response is available as the `json` variable in your expression.

For more complex parsing needs, you can use a file-based transformer:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-custom-endpoint
    config:
      responseFormat:
        path: 'file://transformers/custom-parser.js'
```

See the [Response Path Expressions](#response-path-expressions) section for more details on using JavaScript expressions and file-based transformers.

## Embeddings

To use SageMaker embedding endpoints:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:embedding:my-embedding-endpoint
    config:
      region: 'us-east-1'
      modelType: 'huggingface' # Helps format the request appropriately
```

When using an embedding endpoint, the request should typically be formatted similarly to a text model (JSON with an input string). Ensure your SageMaker container returns embeddings in a JSON format (e.g., a list of floats). For example, a Hugging Face sentence-transformer model will output a JSON array of embeddings.

If the model returns a specific structure, you may need to specify a path:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:embedding:my-embedding-endpoint
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      contentType: application/json
      acceptType: application/json
      # if the model returns {"embedding": [..]} for instance:
      responseFormat:
        path: 'json.embedding'
```

Or if it returns a raw array:

```yaml
responseFormat:
  path: 'json[0]' # first element of the returned array
```

The `embedding:` prefix tells Promptfoo to treat the output as an embedding vector rather than text. This is useful for similarity metrics. You should deploy an embedding model to SageMaker that outputs numerical vectors.

For assertions that require embeddings (like similarity comparisons), you can specify a SageMaker embedding provider:

```yaml
defaultTest:
  options:
    provider:
      embedding:
        id: sagemaker:embedding:my-embedding-endpoint
        config:
          region: us-east-1
```

## Environment Variables

Promptfoo will also read certain environment variables to set default generation parameters:

- `AWS_REGION` or `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`: Default region for SageMaker API calls
- `AWS_SAGEMAKER_MAX_TOKENS`: Default maximum number of tokens to generate
- `AWS_SAGEMAKER_TEMPERATURE`: Default temperature for generation
- `AWS_SAGEMAKER_TOP_P`: Default top_p value for generation
- `AWS_SAGEMAKER_MAX_RETRIES`: Number of retry attempts for failed API calls (default: 3)

These serve as global defaults for your eval runs. You can use them to avoid repetition in config files. Any values set in the provider's YAML config will override these environment defaults.

## Caching Support

The SageMaker provider fully supports the promptfoo caching system, which can significantly speed up evaluations and reduce costs when running repeated tests:

```yaml
# Enable caching in your config
cache: true

providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-endpoint
    config:
      region: us-east-1
```

When caching is enabled:

- Responses for identical prompts are stored and reused
- Token usage statistics are maintained with a `cached` flag
- Debug mode will bypass the cache when needed

You can enable caching with the command line flag:

```bash
promptfoo eval --cache
```

Or disable caching for specific test runs even when globally enabled:

```bash
promptfoo eval --no-cache
```

## Rate Limiting with Delays

SageMaker endpoints will process requests as fast as the underlying instance allows. If you send too many requests in rapid succession, you may saturate the endpoint's capacity and get latency spikes or errors. To avoid this, you can configure a delay between calls.

For example, `delay: 1000` will wait 1 second between each request to the endpoint. This is especially useful to prevent hitting concurrency limits on your model or to avoid invoking autoscaling too aggressively.

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-endpoint
    config:
      region: us-east-1
      delay: 1000 # Add a 1000ms (1 second) delay between API calls
```

You can also specify the delay directly at the provider level:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-endpoint
    delay: 1000 # 1 second delay
    config:
      region: us-east-1
```

Spacing out requests can help avoid bursty usage that might scale up more instances (or, if using a pay-per-request model, it simply spreads out the load). It does not reduce the per-call cost, but it can make the usage more predictable.

Note that delays are only applied for actual API calls, not when responses are retrieved from cache.

## Transforming Prompts

The SageMaker provider supports transforming prompts before they're sent to the endpoint. This is especially useful for:

- Formatting prompts specifically for a particular model type
- Adding system instructions or context
- Converting between different prompt formats
- Preprocessing text for specialized models

You can specify a transform function in your configuration:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-endpoint
    config:
      region: us-east-1
      transform: |
        // Transform the prompt before sending to SageMaker
        return `<s>[INST] ${prompt} [/INST]`
```

For more complex transformations, use a file:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:jumpstart:my-llama-endpoint
    config:
      region: us-west-2
      modelType: jumpstart
      transform: file://transform.js
```

Where `transform.js` might contain:

```javascript
// Transform function for formatting Llama prompts
module.exports = function (prompt, context) {
  return {
    inputs: prompt,
    parameters: {
      max_new_tokens: context.config?.maxTokens || 256,
      temperature: context.config?.temperature || 0.7,
      top_p: context.config?.topP || 0.9,
      do_sample: true,
    },
  };
};
```

You can specify the transform at the provider's top level or within the `config`. Both achieve the same effect; use whatever makes your config clearer. In YAML, using a `file://` path is recommended for complex logic.

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:my-endpoint
    transform: file://transforms/format-prompt.js
    config:
      region: us-east-1
```

Transformed prompts maintain proper caching and include metadata about the transformation in the response.

## Response Path Expressions

The `responseFormat.path` configuration option allows you to extract specific fields from the SageMaker endpoint response using JavaScript expressions or custom transformer functions from files.

### JavaScript Expressions

You can use JavaScript expressions to access nested properties in the response. Use `json` to refer to the response JSON object in the path expression:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: sagemaker:jumpstart:your-jumpstart-endpoint
    label: 'JumpStart model'
    config:
      region: us-east-1
      modelType: jumpstart
      temperature: 0.7
      maxTokens: 256
      responseFormat:
        path: 'json.generated_text'
```

### Response Format Issues

If you're getting unusual responses from your endpoint, try:

1. Setting `modelType` to match your model (or `custom` if unique)
2. Using the `responseFormat.path` option to extract the correct field:
   - For Llama models (JumpStart): Use `responseFormat.path: "json.generated_text"`
   - For Mistral models (Hugging Face): Use `responseFormat.path: "json[0].generated_text"`
3. Checking that your endpoint is correctly processing the input format
4. Adding a delay parameter (e.g., `delay: 500`) to prevent endpoint saturation
