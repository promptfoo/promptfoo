# Write for Promptfoo

If you enjoy Promptfoo, would love to help others learn to use it, and are looking to build your reputation as a writer, this might be just the thing for you!


## Types of content we value

We welcome contributions in various formats:

- **Tutorials and guides** - Step-by-step instructions for common tasks.
- **Integration use cases** - How to use Promptfoo with other tools, especially in the course of building a project or deployment.
- **Best practices** - Tips and tricks for using Promptfoo effectively.

- **Troubleshooting guides** - Solutions to common problems.
- **Integration examples** - How to use Promptfoo with other tools.

## Compensation

We pay anything between $50 - $300 for the work being produced. We value engineering topics more over how-to guides, troublshooting, or integrations.

## Writing guidelines

- Keep it simple and clear
- Use examples and code snippets
- Include screenshots when helpful
- Follow our existing documentation style
- Test your examples before submitting

We expect the final work to have an authentic voice i.e. some form of personality. Anything entirely AI-generated will be rejected. We can do that ourselves.

We also expect support for up to 30 days to keep the article updated. For example, if a new model version is released the article should be updated to use that instead.

## Process

Email tabs@promptfoo.dev with:
- Topic
- Outline
- Estimated length
- Samples of your writing

You will receive a response from anything within a few days to a couple of weeks.

Once your draft is complete you'll need to add it to a GitHub PR, upon which we'll review and provide feedback. Once updates have been made and final checks have passed, we'll publish it on our site. Following this, we'll advertise the work on our social media, newsletter, and Discord.

**Q: May I cross-post to other websites?**  
A: Yes, but only on the condition that canonical URLs are supported and that you use the link from our blog.
