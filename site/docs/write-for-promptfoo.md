# Write for Promptfoo

If you enjoy Promptfoo, want to help others learn it, and would like to build your reputation as a writer, this is for you.

## What we publish

We publish practical guides with working code for engineers developing, securing, and evaluating AI systemsâ€”from LLMs and agent frameworks to multi-agent deployments.

Types of content we value:

- **Engineering deep dives** - Novel benchmarks, evaluation methodologies, red teaming frameworks, safety testing protocols
- **Production system guides** - Real-world Promptfoo deployments at scale, monitoring, observability, and performance optimization
- **Research papers** - Academic work using Promptfoo for evaluation, with reproducible experiments and datasets
- **Tutorials and guides** - Step-by-step instructions with exact commands and reproducible examples
- **Video content** - YouTube tutorials, conference talks, and technical walkthroughs
- **Integrations** - How to use Promptfoo with AI frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex, Crew AI, OpenAI Agents SDK), cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex), CI/CD pipelines, and security tools
- **Case studies** - Real-world deployments, metrics, and lessons learned from production systems
- **Best practices** - Test design, guardrails, data quality, and reproducibility
- **Troubleshooting** - Clear solutions to common problems

> Avoid broad AI explainers. Go deep, show code, and report results.

## Topics we want now

- Production-scale Promptfoo deployments with monitoring and observability
- Building red teaming workflows with Promptfoo in CI
- Novel benchmark designs for multi-agent system evaluation
- Evaluating model upgrades safely across providers (GPT-5, Claude 4, Gemini 2.5)
- Reproducible jailbreak testing with shared datasets and academic rigor
- Guardrail comparisons using Promptfoo evals
- Promptfoo + OpenAI Agents SDK/CrewAI integration with live repo and CI
- AI security testing workflows and best practices
- Performance optimization for large-scale evaluation systems
- Migrating from ad-hoc tests to evaluation plans

## Compensation

We pay for quality technical content. Deep engineering posts with working code get more than basic tutorials.

## Writing guidelines

- Keep it clear and specific
- Include runnable code with exact commands
- Use version pins for models, SDKs, and Promptfoo
- Add screenshots when helpful (include alt text)
- Test all steps and provide a repo or example files
- Follow our existing documentation style

Write in your own voice. AI-assist is fine, but we reject copy-paste ChatGPT output.

**Maintenance**: For 30 days after publication, we may request minor updates. Substantial revisions will be scoped separately.

## How to pitch

Email [inquiries@promptfoo.dev](mailto:inquiries@promptfoo.dev) with:
