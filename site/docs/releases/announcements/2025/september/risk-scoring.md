# Risk Scoring - Quantify Your AI Security Posture

We've added a **comprehensive risk scoring system** that quantifies security vulnerabilities across your AI applications. Move beyond pass/fail metrics to understand the actual risk exposure of your systems.

## The Problem with Binary Results

Traditional red team testing gives binary results: a test either passes or fails. But not all failures are equal:

- Is a minor prompt injection as risky as credential leakage?
- Should you prioritize fixing PII leaks or hallucination issues?
- How do you measure security improvement over time?

Risk scores solve this by providing **quantitative security metrics** that help you prioritize remediation efforts.

## How Risk Scoring Works

### Multi-Factor Risk Assessment

Risk scores consider multiple dimensions:

1. **Severity** - How harmful is the vulnerability?
   - Critical: Data breaches, credential exposure
   - High: Jailbreaks, harmful content generation
   - Medium: Prompt leaks, minor policy violations
   - Low: Edge case failures, minor inconsistencies

2. **Probability** - How likely is exploitation?
   - Fails consistently across strategies
   - Requires specific attack techniques
   - Only fails under rare conditions

3. **Impact** - What's the business consequence?
   - Regulatory violations (GDPR, HIPAA)
   - Customer data exposure
   - Reputational damage
   - Service disruption

### Aggregate Scoring

Red team reports now display:

- **Overall risk score** - Single metric for system security
- **Risk by category** - Scores for different vulnerability types
- **Risk trend** - Track improvement over time
- **Risk heatmap** - Identify high-risk areas visually

## Using Risk Scores

### Prioritize Remediation

Focus engineering effort where it matters most:

```
Critical Risk (Score 9-10): Fix immediately
High Risk (Score 7-8): Prioritize for next sprint
Medium Risk (Score 4-6): Address in backlog
Low Risk (Score 1-3): Monitor, fix when convenient
```

### Track Security Improvement

Measure the impact of security work:

- **Before remediation**: Risk score 8.2
- **After prompt hardening**: Risk score 6.1
- **After content filtering**: Risk score 3.4

### Compliance Reporting

Map risk scores to compliance requirements:

- **ISO 42001**: Aggregate scores by framework control
- **SOC 2**: Evidence of continuous security monitoring
- **GDPR**: Quantify data protection measures

### Executive Communication

Translate technical findings to business impact:

> "Our AI chatbot has a risk score of 7.3 (High). The primary risks are PII leakage (score 9.1) and jailbreak vulnerabilities (score 8.6). Implementing the recommended guardrails will reduce the score to 4.2 (Medium)."

## Risk Score in Reports

Vulnerability reports now include:

### Summary Card
```
Overall Risk Score: 7.3 / 10 (High)
Critical Issues: 3
High Risk: 12
Medium Risk: 45
Low Risk: 89
```

### Category Breakdown
```
PII Leakage: 9.1 (Critical)
Jailbreak: 8.6 (Critical)
Harmful Content: 7.2 (High)
Prompt Leaks: 5.4 (Medium)
Hallucination: 4.1 (Medium)
```

### Remediation Impact
```
Fix PII issues: -2.8 points
Implement jailbreak protection: -2.1 points
Add content filters: -1.3 points
```

## Integration with Workflows

Risk scores integrate with your existing processes:

- **CI/CD gates** - Block deployments if risk score exceeds threshold
- **Ticketing systems** - Auto-create issues for high-risk findings
- **Dashboards** - Track security posture across all AI systems
- **Alerts** - Notify teams when risk scores increase

## Best Practices

1. **Set risk thresholds** for different deployment environments
   - Production: Risk score ≤ 4.0
   - Staging: Risk score ≤ 6.0
   - Development: No threshold

2. **Monitor trends** not just absolute scores
   - Rising scores indicate new vulnerabilities
   - Falling scores show security improvements

3. **Contextualize scores** for your industry
   - Healthcare may have lower tolerance than consumer apps
   - Financial services need stricter thresholds

4. **Combine with qualitative analysis**
   - Risk scores guide priorities
   - Manual review validates findings

## What's Next

Future enhancements:
- **Custom risk models** - Define your own scoring criteria
- **Predictive risk** - Forecast future vulnerabilities
- **Comparative analysis** - Benchmark against industry peers
- **Risk budgets** - Allocate acceptable risk across systems

Risk scoring transforms red teaming from finding bugs to managing security as a measurable, improvable metric.
