# Using the web viewer

The web viewer is an experimental, work-in-progress UI for viewing prompt outputs side-by-side.

To start it, run:

```
npx promptfoo@latest view
```

After you [run an eval](/docs/getting-started), the viewer will present the latest results in a view like this one:

![promptfoo web viewer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/310310/244891219-2b79e8f8-9b79-49e7-bffb-24cba18352f2.png)

Currently, the viewer is just an easier way to look at output. It automatically updates on every eval, and allows you to thumbs up/thumbs down individual outputs to more easily compare prompts.

Remember, you can always [output](/docs/configuration/parameters#output-file) to terminal, HTML, CSV, or JSON instead if you're looking for something more portable.

The web viewer is under development and will eventually include features such as: configuring and re-running evals and viewing history.

## Sharing

To get a URL that you can send to others, click the 'Share' button in the top right. This will generate a URL that others can load to view your config and results.

Shared data is temporarily stored on our servers, and permanently deleted after 1 week, at which point the URL will cease to function. Shared data is "private" in the sense that the UUID-based URL is unguessable, but if you publish your URL then anyone can access it (similar to a Github secret gist).
