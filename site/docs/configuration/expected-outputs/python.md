# Python assertions

The `python` assertion allows you to provide a custom Python function to validate the LLM output.

A variable named `output` is injected into the context. The function should return `true` if the output passes the assertion, and `false` otherwise. If the function returns a number, it will be treated as a score.

Example:

```yaml
assert:
  - type: python
    value: output[5:10] == 'Hello'
```

You may also return a number, which will be treated as a score:

```yaml
assert:
  - type: python
    value: math.log10(len(output)) * 10
```

## Multiline functions

Python assertions support multiline strings:

```yaml
assert:
  - type: python
    value: |
      # Insert your scoring logic here...
      if output == 'Expected output':
          return {
            'pass': True,
            'score': 0.5,
          }
      else:
          return {
            'pass': False,
            'score': 0,
          }
```

## Using test context

A `context` object is available in the Python function. Here is its type definition:

```py
class AssertContext:
    prompt: str
    vars: Dict[str, Union[str, object]]
```

For example, if the test case has a var `example`, access it in Python like this:

```yaml
tests:
  - description: 'Test with context'
    vars:
      example: 'Example text'
    assert:
      - type: python
        value: 'context['vars']['example'] in output'
```

## External .py

To reference an external file, use the `file://` prefix:

```yaml
assert:
  - type: python
    value: file://relative/path/to/script.py
```

This file will be called with an `output` string and an `AssertContext` object. It expects that either a bool (pass/fail), float (score), or `GradingResult` will be returned.

Here's an example assert.py:

```py
def get_assert(output, context) -> Union[bool, float, Gradingresult]
    print('Prompt:', context['prompt'])
    print('Vars', context['vars']['topic']

    success = test_output(output)

    return success

class GradingResult:
    pass: bool
    score: float
    reason: str
```

## Overriding the Python binary

By default, promptfoo will run `python` in your shell. Make sure `python` points to the appropriate executable.

If a `python` binary is not present, you will see a "python: command not found" error.

To override the Python binary, set the `PROMPTFOO_PYTHON` environment variable. You may set it to a path (such as `/path/to/python3.11`) or just an executable in your PATH (such as `python3.11`).
