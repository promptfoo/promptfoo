# Findings and Reports 

Promptfoo Enterprise allows you to review findings and reports from scans within the Promptfoo application. 

## Reviewing the Dashboard

The dashboard is the main page for reviewing findings and reports. It displays a summary of all the scans that have been run, including the number of findings and reports generated.

## Viewing Vulnerability Reports

The "Vulnerabilities" section displays a list of all the vulnerabilities that have been found. You can filter based on the target, severity level, status of finding, risk category, or type of vulnerability. 

Selecting a vulnerability will open a finding that shows you the details of the vulnerability, including details about the types of strategies that were used to exploit the vulnerability, records of the probes that were used, the instances when the vulnerability was identified during scans, and remediation recommendations. 

You can modify the status of the finding as either "Marked as Fixed", "False Positive", or "Ignore". You can also add comments to the finding to provide additional context about the vulnerability, as well as change the severity level of the vulnerability based on your company's risk assessment. 

## How Grading Works

Grading is the process of evaluating the success of a red team attack. Promptfoo grades results based on the application context that is provided when creating a target.
