# Claude 3.5 vs GPT-4o: Benchmark on Your Own Data

When evaluating the performance of LLMs, generic benchmarks will only get you so far. This is especially the case for Claude vs GPT, as there are many split evaluations (subjective and objective) on their efficacy.

You should test these models on tasks that are relevant to your specific use case, rather than relying solely on public benchmarks.

This guide will walk you through setting up a comparison between Anthropic's Claude 3.5 and OpenAI's GPT-4o using `promptfoo`. The end result is a side-by-side evaluation of how these models perform on custom tasks:

![Claude 3.5 vs GPT-4o comparison](/img/docs/claude3.5-vs-gpt4o.png)

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have:

- The `promptfoo` CLI installed ([installation instructions](/docs/getting-started))
- API keys for Anthropic (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and OpenAI (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)

## Step 1: Set Up Your Evaluation

Create a new directory for your comparison project:

```sh
npx promptfoo@latest init claude3.5-vs-gpt4o
cd claude3.5-vs-gpt4o
```

Open the generated `promptfooconfig.yaml` file. This is where you'll configure the models to test, the prompts to use, and the test cases to run.

### Configure the Models

Specify the Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o model IDs under `providers`:

```yaml
providers:
  - anthropic:messages:claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
  - openai:chat:gpt-4o
```

You can optionally set parameters like temperature and max tokens for each model:

```yaml
providers:
  - id: anthropic:messages:claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620
    config:
      temperature: 0.3
      max_tokens: 1024
  - id: openai:chat:gpt-4o
    config:
      temperature: 0.3
      max_tokens: 1024
```

### Define Your Prompts

Next, define the prompt(s) you want to test the models on. For this example, we'll just use a simple prompt:

```yaml
prompts:
  - 'Answer this riddle: {{riddle}}
```

If desired, you can use a prompt template defined in a separate `prompt.yaml` or `prompt.json` file. This makes it easier to set the system message, etc:

```yaml
prompts:
  - file://prompt.yaml
```

The contents of `prompt.yaml`:

```yaml
- role: system
  content: 'You are a careful riddle solver. Be concise.'
- role: user
  content: |
    Answer this riddle:
    {{riddle}}
```

The `{{riddle}}` placeholder will be populated by test case variables.

## Step 2: Create Test Cases

Now it's time to create a set of test cases that represent the types of queries your application needs to handle.

The key is to focus your analysis on the cases that matter most for your application. Think about the edge cases and specific competencies that you need in an LLM.

In this example, we'll use a few riddles to test the models' reasoning and language understanding capabilities:

```yaml
tests:
  - vars:
      riddle: 'I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?'
    assert:
      - type: icontains
        value: echo
  - vars:
      riddle: "You see a boat filled with people. It has not sunk, but when you look again you don't see a single person on the boat. Why?"
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: explains that the people are below deck or they are all in a relationship
  - vars:
      riddle: 'The more of this there is, the less you see. What is it?'
    assert:
      - type: icontains
        value: darkness
  # ... more test cases
```

The `assert` blocks allow you to automatically check the model outputs for expected content. This is useful for tracking performance over time as you refine your prompts.

:::tip
`promptfoo` supports a very wide variety of assertions, ranging from basic asserts to model-graded to assertions specialized for RAG applications.

## Step 3: Run the Evaluation

With your configuration complete, you can kick off the evaluation:

```
npx promptfoo@latest eval
```

This will run each test case against both Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o and record the results.

To view the results, start up the `promptfoo` viewer:

```sh
npx promptfoo@latest view
```

This will display a comparison view showing how Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o performed on each test case:

![Claude 3.5 vs GPT-4o comparison expanded](/img/docs/claude3-vs-gpt4-expanded.png)

You can also output the raw results data to a file:

```
npx promptfoo@latest eval -o results.json
```

## Step 4: Analyze the Results

With the evaluation complete, it's time to dig into the results and see how the models compared on your test cases.

Some key things to look for:

- Which model had a higher overall pass rate on the test assertions? In this case, both models did equally well in terms of getting the answer, which is great - these riddles often trip up less powerful models like GPT 3.5 and Claude 2.
- Were there specific test cases where one model significantly outperformed the other?
- How did the models compare on other output quality metrics.
- Consider model properties like speed and cost in addition to quality.

Here are a few observations from our example riddle test set:

- GPT 4o's responses tended to be shorter, while Claude 3.5 often includes extra commentary
- GPT 4o was about 7x faster
- GPT 4o was about 3x cheaper

### Adding assertions for things we care about

Based on the above observations, let's add the following assertions to all tests in this eval:

- Latency must be under 2000 ms
- Cost must be under $0.0025
- Sliding scale Javascript function that penalizes long responses

```yaml
defaultTest:
  assert:
    - type: cost
      threshold: 0.0025
    - type: latency
      threshold: 2000
    - type: javascript
      value: 'output.length <= 100 ? 1 : output.length > 1000 ? 0 : 1 - (output.length - 100) / 900'
```

We're also going to update the system prompt to say, "Be concise".

The result is that Claude 3.5 frequently fails our latency requirements:

![claude latency assertions](/img/docs/claude3-vs-gpt4-latency.png)

Clicking into a specific test case shows the individual test results:

Of course, our requirements are different from yours. You should customize these values to suit your use case.

## Conclusion

By running this type of targeted evaluation, you can gain valuable insights into how Claude 3.5 and GPT-4o are likely to perform on your application's real-world data and tasks.

`promptfoo` makes it easy to set up a repeatable evaluation pipeline so you can test models as they evolve and measure the impact of model and prompt changes.

The end goal: choose the best foundation model for your use case with empirical data.
