# Production Log Analysis & Continuous Improvement

Production log analysis transforms your historical conversation data into actionable insights for security, quality, and business optimization. This guide shows how to build a **continuous improvement flywheel** that makes your LLM system better with every conversation.

![Production Log Analysis Flywheel](./screenshots/production-log-flywheel.png)

## Why Production Log Analysis Matters

Traditional LLM evaluation happens before deployment. **Production log analysis** evaluates what actually happened in real conversations with real users, revealing:

- **Security vulnerabilities** in deployed systems
- **Quality degradation** over time
- **Business outcomes** from conversations
- **Performance patterns** under real load

This creates a flywheel effect where each analysis cycle improves your system automatically.

## Quick Start: 5-Minute Setup

### 1. Export Your Conversation Logs

Most systems can export conversations as JSONL:

```jsonl title="production-logs.jsonl"
{"session_id":"sess_001","role":"user","message":"Help me reset my password","timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z","metadata":{"channel":"web_chat"}}
{"session_id":"sess_001","role":"assistant","message":"I'll help you reset your password. Please verify your email address.","timestamp":"2024-01-15T10:30:02Z","metadata":{"agent_id":"agent_001"}}
```

### 2. Create Analysis Provider

```javascript title="conversation-replay-provider.js"
const fs = require('fs');

class ConversationReplayProvider {
  constructor(options) {
    this.config = options.config;
    this.conversations = this.loadConversations();
    this.analytics = this.generateAnalytics();
  }

  id() {
    return 'conversation-replay';
  }

  loadConversations() {
    const rawData = fs.readFileSync(this.config.logFile, 'utf8');
    const lines = rawData.split('\n').filter(line => line.trim());

    const conversations = {};
    for (const line of lines) {
      const entry = JSON.parse(line);
      const sessionId = entry.session_id;

      if (!conversations[sessionId]) {
        conversations[sessionId] = {
          id: sessionId,
          messages: [],
          metadata: {
            security_incidents: [],
            quality_issues: [],
            business_outcomes: []
          }
        };
      }

      conversations[sessionId].messages.push(entry);
      this.analyzeEntry(conversations[sessionId], entry);
    }

    return conversations;
  }

  analyzeEntry(conversation, entry) {
    // Security analysis
    this.detectSecurityIncidents(conversation, entry);
    // Quality analysis
    this.assessQuality(conversation, entry);
    // Business analysis
    this.trackBusinessOutcomes(conversation, entry);
  }

  async callApi(prompt, context) {
    const conversationId = context?.vars?.conversationId;
    const mode = context?.vars?.mode || 'conversation';

    if (mode === 'security_report') {
      return { output: this.generateSecurityReport() };
    }

    if (mode === 'analytics') {
      return { output: this.generateAnalytics() };
    }

    // Return specific conversation
    const conversation = this.conversations[conversationId];
    return {
      output: this.formatConversation(conversation),
      metadata: conversation.metadata
    };
  }
}

module.exports = ConversationReplayProvider;
```

### 3. Configure Analysis

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
providers:
  - id: file://conversation-replay-provider.js
    config:
      logFile: './production-logs.jsonl'

tests:
  # Security Analysis
  - description: 'Security vulnerability detection'
    vars:
      mode: 'security_report'
    assert:
      - type: contains
        value: 'SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT'
      - type: javascript
        value: 'context.metadata.security_incidents === 0' # Zero incidents is good!

  # Quality Assessment
  - description: 'Conversation quality analysis'
    vars:
      conversationId: 'sess_001'
      mode: 'conversation'
    assert:
      - type: javascript
        value: 'context.metadata.quality_score >= 7'

  # Business Intelligence
  - description: 'Business outcomes tracking'
    vars:
      mode: 'analytics'
    assert:
      - type: contains
        value: 'BUSINESS IMPACT'
      - type: javascript
        value: 'context.metadata.total_revenue_impact > 0'
```

### 4. Run Analysis

```bash
promptfoo eval -c promptfooconfig.yaml

## Security Vulnerability Detection

### Detecting Attack Patterns

```javascript
detectSecurityIncidents(conversation, entry) {
  const content = entry.message?.toLowerCase() || '';
  const metadata = entry.metadata || {};

  // Prompt injection detection
  if (content.includes('ignore all previous instructions') ||
      content.includes('you are now')) {
    conversation.metadata.security_incidents.push({
      type: 'prompt_injection',
      severity: 'high',
      timestamp: entry.timestamp,
      blocked: metadata.attack_blocked || false
    });
  }

  // PII exposure detection
  if (metadata.pii_violation) {
    conversation.metadata.security_incidents.push({
      type: 'pii_exposure',
      severity: 'critical',
      timestamp: entry.timestamp,
      data_type: metadata.pii_violation
    });
  }

  // Social engineering detection
  if (content.includes('i am from it') || content.includes('urgent audit')) {
    conversation.metadata.security_incidents.push({
      type: 'social_engineering',
      severity: 'high',
      timestamp: entry.timestamp,
      technique: 'authority_claim'
    });
  }
}
```

### Security Report Example

```
🔒 SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
⚠️  23 security incidents detected
⚠️  8 high-risk conversations identified
⚠️  35% of attacks were not blocked

INCIDENT BREAKDOWN:
PROMPT_INJECTION: 12 total (8 blocked, 4 unblocked)
SOCIAL_ENGINEERING: 7 total (5 blocked, 2 unblocked)
PII_EXPOSURE: 3 total (0 blocked, 3 unblocked)
DATA_HARVESTING: 1 total (1 blocked, 0 unblocked)

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Review conversations with security_risk_score >= 7
2. Implement additional training for PII handling
3. Enhance detection for social engineering
4. Update input sanitization rules
```

![Security Incidents Timeline](./screenshots/security-timeline.png)

## Quality Assessment & Improvement

### Automated Quality Scoring

```javascript
calculateQualityScore(conversation) {
  let score = 10; // Start with perfect score

  const issues = conversation.metadata.quality_issues;
  for (const issue of issues) {
    switch (issue.severity) {
      case 'high': score -= 3; break;
      case 'medium': score -= 2; break;
      case 'low': score -= 1; break;
    }
  }

  // Bonus for good metrics
  if (conversation.metadata.resolution_time < 60) score += 1;
  if (conversation.metadata.avg_response_time < 2000) score += 1;

  return Math.max(0, Math.min(10, score));
}
```

### Quality Issues Detection

```javascript
analyzeQualityIssues(conversation, entry) {
  const content = entry.message || '';

  // Detect poor responses
  if (entry.role === 'assistant' && content.length < 20) {
    conversation.metadata.quality_issues.push({
      type: 'response_too_brief',
      severity: 'medium',
      description: `Response only ${content.length} characters`
    });
  }

  // Detect unhelpful responses
  if (content.includes("I don't understand") ||
      content.includes("I cannot help")) {
    conversation.metadata.quality_issues.push({
      type: 'unhelpful_response',
      severity: 'high',
      description: 'Agent unable to assist customer'
    });
  }
}
```

## Business Intelligence & ROI Tracking

### Revenue Impact Analysis

```javascript
trackBusinessOutcomes(conversation, entry) {
  const metadata = entry.metadata || {};

  // Track upsells
  if (metadata.upsell_completed) {
    conversation.metadata.business_outcomes.push({
      type: 'upsell_success',
      revenue_impact: metadata.revenue_impact || 0,
      plan_change: metadata.new_plan
    });
  }

  // Track churn prevention
  if (metadata.retention_successful) {
    conversation.metadata.business_outcomes.push({
      type: 'churn_prevention',
      revenue_impact: metadata.monthly_value || 29.99
    });
  }

  // Track cancellations
  if (metadata.action_taken === 'cancellation_processed') {
    conversation.metadata.business_outcomes.push({
      type: 'churn',
      revenue_impact: -(metadata.monthly_value || 29.99),
      reason: metadata.cancellation_reason
    });
  }
}
```

### Automated Pipeline Setup

```yaml title="flywheel-automation.yaml"
# Set up automated analysis pipeline
schedule: "daily at 2:00 AM"

stages:
  capture:
    source: "s3://prod-logs/conversations/*"
    format: "jsonl"
    retention: "30 days"

  analyze:
    parallel: true
    evaluations:

  measure:
    baseline_comparison: true
    metrics:
      - security_incident_rate
      - avg_quality_score
      - business_outcomes
```

## Advanced Analysis Techniques

### Cross-Conversation Pattern Detection

```javascript
// Detect patterns across multiple conversations
analyzeConversationPatterns() {
  const patterns = {
    security_trends: this.detectSecurityTrends(),
    quality_degradation: this.detectQualityDegradation(),
    business_opportunities: this.identifyBusinessOpportunities()
  };

  return patterns;
}

detectSecurityTrends() {
  const incidents = this.getAllSecurityIncidents();

  return {
    trending_attacks: this.groupBy(incidents, 'type'),
    attack_success_rate: this.calculateBlockRate(incidents),
    new_patterns: this.identifyNewAttackPatterns(incidents),
    geographic_distribution: this.analyzeAttackOrigins(incidents)
  };
}
```

### Predictive Quality Monitoring

```javascript
// Predict which conversations will need escalation
predictEscalationRisk(conversation) {
  const riskFactors = {
    // High response time indicates struggling agent
    slow_responses: conversation.avg_response_time > 5000,

    // Multiple agent handoffs suggest complexity
    agent_changes: conversation.agent_changes > 1,

    // Repeated clarification requests
    clarification_loops: conversation.clarification_requests > 2,

    // Negative sentiment detection
    customer_frustration: conversation.sentiment_score < -0.5
  };

  const risk_score = Object.values(riskFactors).filter(Boolean).length;
  return {
    risk_level: risk_score >= 3 ? 'high' : risk_score >= 2 ? 'medium' : 'low',
    escalation_probability: risk_score / 4,
    recommended_actions: this.getRecommendedActions(riskFactors)
  };
}
```

### ROI Calculation & Reporting

```javascript
// Calculate business value of improvements
calculateROI() {
  const investments = {
    setup_time: 40, // hours
    ongoing_analysis: 2 * 4, // hours per week for a month
    improvements: 16 // hours implementing changes
  };

  const returns = {
    security: {
      prevented_breaches: 1,
      estimated_cost_avoidance: 50000
    },
    quality: {
      escalation_reduction: 0.23,
      support_cost_savings: 8000
    },
    business: {
      upsell_improvement: 0.48,
      additional_mrr: 2400
    }
  };

  const total_investment = investments.setup_time * 100; // $100/hour
  const monthly_returns = returns.quality.support_cost_savings +
                         returns.business.additional_mrr;

  return {
    monthly_roi: (monthly_returns / total_investment) * 100,
    payback_period_months: total_investment / monthly_returns,
    annual_value: monthly_returns * 12
  };
}
```

## Best Practices

### Data Privacy & Security
- **Sanitize logs** before analysis to remove PII
- **Encrypt stored data** and use secure transfer protocols
- **Implement access controls** for sensitive analysis results
- **Audit log access** and maintain compliance documentation

### Performance Optimization
- **Process logs incrementally** rather than full re-analysis
- **Cache analysis results** to avoid duplicate computation
- **Use parallel processing** for large log volumes
- **Archive old data** to manage storage costs

### Team Collaboration
- **Share insights regularly** with security, product, and business teams
- **Create action items** from analysis findings
- **Track improvement metrics** over time
- **Celebrate wins** and learn from failures

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Low Pass Rates
If your analysis is failing many tests:

1. **Check log format** - Ensure JSONL structure matches expected schema
2. **Verify test assertions** - Make sure expectations align with actual output
3. **Review provider logic** - Debug conversation parsing and analysis code
4. **Start simple** - Begin with basic tests and add complexity gradually

### Missing Security Issues
If security analysis isn't detecting known issues:

1. **Update detection patterns** - Add new attack signatures to analysis code
2. **Check metadata** - Ensure security-relevant data is captured in logs
3. **Validate test data** - Confirm your test conversations contain actual issues
4. **Tune sensitivity** - Adjust detection thresholds to reduce false negatives

### Performance Problems
If analysis is too slow:

1. **Batch process** - Analyze logs in smaller chunks
2. **Optimize queries** - Use efficient data structures and algorithms
3. **Parallel processing** - Run multiple analyses simultaneously
4. **Cache results** - Store computed metrics to avoid re-analysis
