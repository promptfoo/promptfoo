# Promptfoo Enterprise

Promptfoo offers two deployment options to meet your security needs:

**Promptfoo Enterprise** is our hosted SaaS solution that lets you securely scan your LLM applications without managing infrastructure.

**Promptfoo Enterprise On-Prem** is our on-premises solution that includes a dedicated runner for deployments behind your firewall.

Both solutions offer a suite of tools to help you secure your LLM applications, including:

- Robust RBAC controls to manage multiple users and teams
- Teams-based configurability for customizing targets, plugins, and scan configurations
- Detailed reporting and analytics to monitor the security of your LLM applications
- Remediation suggestions to help you fix vulnerabilities
- Advanced filtering to find and sort through evals
- Sharing and exporting functions to integrate Promptfoo with your existing tools

Our platform works with any LLM application, agent, or foundation model that is live and ready for inference.
