# Test Images

This directory contains a sample image for the Azure OpenAI vision example:

- `earth.jpg` - NASA's Blue Marble image of Earth (public domain) used to demonstrate three different ways to load images (URL, file://, and base64)

The image is automatically loaded and converted to base64 when using `file://` paths in the configuration.
