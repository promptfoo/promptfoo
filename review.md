# Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Support Review

This review covers the addition of Gemini 2.5 Flash image generation support for Google AI Studio and Vertex AI in promptfoo.

## Overall Impression

The implementation is comprehensive and well-executed. It includes:
- Support for both AI Studio and Vertex AI.
- A rich set of examples showcasing various features of the model.
- Cost calculation for the new model.
- Updates to the UI to handle base64 images.

The examples are fun, engaging, and do a great job of demonstrating the capabilities of Gemini 2.5 Flash.

Below are my detailed findings from the code audit and testing.

## Code Review

### `src/providers/google/ai.studio.ts` & `src/providers/google/vertex.ts`

- **[Suggestion] Redundant `responseModalities` logic**: The logic to set `responseModalities` is duplicated in both `AIStudioChatProvider` and `VertexChatProvider`. This could be centralized in a common utility function or a base class method to avoid code duplication.

- **[Info] Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation logic in `calculateCost` seems correct based on the pricing information in the `README.md` ($30 per 1M output tokens). The fallback estimates for other models are reasonable.

### `src/providers/google/util.ts`

- **[Info] `formatCandidateContents`**: The changes to this function are well-implemented. It correctly handles `inlineData` for images and formats them as markdown. The logic to join multiple parts with newlines is also good.

### `src/app/src/pages/eval/components/TruncatedText.tsx`

- **[Info] Base64 Truncation Fix**: The fix to prevent truncation of base64 image data is a crucial improvement for the user experience. This is a great catch.

## Example Review (`examples/google-gemini-image/`)

The examples are excellent. They are well-structured and cover a wide range of use cases.

- **`promptfooconfig.yaml`**: This is a great starting point for users. The prompts are creative and the assertions are well-defined.
- **`promptfooconfig-vertex.yaml`**: Good to have a separate config for Vertex AI.
- **`test-comprehensive.yaml`**: This file is fantastic. The prompts are fun and imaginative ("Magical unicorn in cyberpunk city", "Taco truck in space"). The custom Javascript assertions are a great way to showcase advanced promptfoo features.
- **`test-image-input-output.yaml`**: This is a very important test case, as it demonstrates the model's ability to take images as input. The smiley face example is simple and effective.
- **`test-cost-only.yaml`**: A good, focused test for cost calculation.

### Suggestions for Examples

- **[Suggestion] Add a "bad prompt" example**: It might be useful to include an example of a prompt that is expected to fail, to demonstrate how promptfoo can be used to catch regressions or unexpected model behavior. For example, a prompt that asks for something the model can't do, with an assertion that checks for a specific failure message.
- **[Suggestion] More complex `llm-rubric`**: The `README.md` mentions `llm-rubric`, but the examples mostly use `contains` and `javascript`. It would be great to have a more complex `llm-rubric` example that evaluates the artistic quality of the generated image in more detail.

## Testing

I will now proceed with testing the examples. I will update this review with the results.

**Test Plan:**

1. Run `promptfooconfig.yaml`.
2. Run `promptfooconfig-vertex.yaml`.
3. Run `test-comprehensive.yaml`.
4. Run `test-image-input-output.yaml`.
5. Run `test-cost-only.yaml`.

I will be looking for:
- Successful execution of the `eval` command.
- No errors in the output.
- Correct rendering of images in the web viewer.
- Accurate cost reporting.
