## Option A: Lead with the questions (recommended)

---

"Provide your model card."
"Document your evaluation methodology."
"Describe your bias testing process."

If you build AI applications, you've probably noticed these questions multiplying in enterprise security questionnaires and customer contracts.

They're not random. They have specific regulatory sources—and specific deadlines in 2026:

📅 Jan 1: California training data transparency (AB 2013)
📅 Mar 11: Federal LLM procurement requirements (OMB M-26-04)
📅 Jun 30: Colorado algorithmic discrimination (SB24-205)
📅 Aug: California content provenance + EU AI Act high-risk rules

I wrote a field guide for practitioners covering what changed in 2025 and what's coming:

→ How regulation actually reaches your product (the "compliance stack")
→ What federal agencies now require from LLM vendors
→ Why state laws and federal policy are in direct conflict
→ EU AI Act timeline after November's delay proposal
→ How agentic systems complicate everything

Primary sources throughout. No paywall.

## Option B: Shorter, punchier

---

"Provide your model card."
"Document your evaluation methodology."
"Describe your bias testing process."

If you've seen these questions appear in security questionnaires over the past year, you're not imagining it.

The regulatory sources are real. The deadlines are specific. And 2026 is when they arrive.

I wrote a field guide: what changed in 2025, what's coming in 2026, and what practitioners actually need to know.

Primary sources. No paywall.

## Option C: Lead with the thesis

### Version 1: Scannable cascade + dates

---

Here's what happened to AI regulation in 2025:

Executive orders became OMB memos.
OMB memos became procurement language.
Procurement language became contract requirements.
Contract requirements became the questions you're answering in security questionnaires right now.

The compliance stack filled in. And in 2026, specific deadlines arrive:

📅 March — Federal LLM procurement requirements
📅 June — Colorado algorithmic discrimination
📅 August — EU AI Act high-risk rules

I wrote a field guide for practitioners covering what changed and what's coming. Federal policy, state laws, EU, China. Why state and federal requirements are now in direct conflict. How agentic systems complicate compliance assumptions.

### Version 2: Tighter, more conversational

---

AI regulation used to be policy papers and executive orders. Abstract. Distant.

In 2025, it became procurement language, contract clauses, and the questions you're now answering in enterprise security questionnaires.

The compliance stack filled in. And in 2026, deadlines arrive—March for federal procurement, June for Colorado, August for the EU.

I wrote a field guide for practitioners:

→ How regulation actually reaches your product
→ What federal agencies now require from LLM vendors
→ Why state and federal policy are in direct conflict
→ How agentic systems break compliance assumptions

Primary sources. No paywall.

### Version 3: Dense, punchy

---

In 2025, AI regulation went from abstract to concrete.

EO → OMB memo → procurement language → contract clause → the security questionnaire sitting in your inbox.

The stack filled in. 2026 is when deadlines arrive.

I wrote a field guide: federal LLM requirements, state laws, EU AI Act, China's filing system. What changed, what's coming, and why state and federal policy are now in direct conflict.

Primary sources throughout.

## Notes

- **Link placement:** LinkedIn's algorithm allegedly penalizes links in post body. "Link in comments" is common practice—post the link as your first comment immediately after publishing.

- **Character count:** Option A is ~1,100 chars, Option B is ~550 chars, Option C is ~750 chars. All well under LinkedIn's 3,000 char limit. Option A shows more before the "see more" fold.

- **Hashtags:** Keep to 3-5. #AICompliance #AIRegulation #LLM or #MachineLearning are relevant. Avoid overly generic ones like #AI.

- **Timing:** Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am in your target timezone. Avoid weekends.

- **First comment:** Have the link ready to paste immediately after posting:

- **Engagement:** Respond to early comments quickly—LinkedIn's algorithm favors posts with early engagement.
