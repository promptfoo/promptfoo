# Monthly Release Roundups Guidelines

This rule provides comprehensive guidelines for creating monthly roundups of Promptfoo releases. These summaries publish automatically to the `/releases/` section of the website and highlight key developments, major features, and important updates from each month.

## File Naming Convention

Name monthly roundup files using this pattern:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-month-roundup.md
```

Use the last day of the month being summarized as the date.

Examples:

- `2025-03-31-march-roundup.md`
- `2025-04-30-april-roundup.md`
- `2025-05-31-may-roundup.md`

## Front Matter Template

Include this front matter in each monthly roundup:

```yaml
---
slug: month-YYYY-roundup
title: Month YYYY Roundup - Descriptive Theme Title
description: Brief summary of the month's key developments (under 160 chars for SEO)
authors: [promptfoo_team]
tags: [roundup, month-yyyy, key-feature1, key-feature2, monthly-summary]
keywords: [feature1, feature2, feature3, monthly, roundup]
date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM
---
```

:::note

Format the `keywords` field as an array and use the `T` separator with specific time (typically `T23:59` for end of month).

:::

## Content Structure

Structure monthly roundups consistently:

1. **Title and Introduction** - Overview of the month's significance and theme
2. **<!-- truncate -->** - Docusaurus blog truncation marker
3. **:::info Month YYYY Highlights** - Callout box with key developments
4. **📊 Month YYYY By The Numbers** - Key statistics (X releases, Y features, etc.)
5. **🚀 Major Features** - Most significant new features and capabilities
6. **🛡️ Security & Safety Advances** - Red team and safety improvements
7. **⚡ Performance & Infrastructure** - Technical improvements and optimizations
8. **🎨 Developer Experience / WebUI** - UX/DX enhancements and usability improvements
9. **🐛 Fixes & Stability** - Important bug fixes and stability improvements
10. **📦 Getting Started** - Installation/upgrade instructions with examples
11. **🔗 See Also** - Links to relevant documentation and resources
12. **Conclusion & Community Engagement** - Summary and call to action
13. **Navigation Links** - Previous/Next roundup references

## Writing Guidelines

### Monthly Summary Focus

- **Aggregate multiple releases** from the month into coherent themes
- **Highlight the biggest impacts** rather than listing every minor change
- **Show progression** and how features build on each other across releases
- **Include key statistics** like "X major releases" and "Y new features"
- **Use matter-of-fact descriptions** with direct, action-oriented language

### Tone and Language

- **Use direct, factual language** - avoid promotional terms like "revolutionary," "groundbreaking," or "game-changing"
- **Be action-oriented** - clearly outline what users can do with new features
- **Avoid overselling** - describe features objectively without superlatives
- **Write for evergreen value** - focus on practical capabilities rather than momentary excitement
- **Use imperative mood** for instructions (e.g., "Install the package" instead of "You should install the package")

### Version Number References

Include version numbers in parentheses when referencing features:

- "Model scanner command (v0.107.0)"
- "Advanced metrics (v0.112.0, v0.110.0)"
- "Major releases (v0.106.0 → v0.107.0)"

### Use Clear Headings

- Use descriptive section headings with emojis for visual appeal
- Organize content by impact (major features > improvements > fixes)
- Group related features from different releases into cohesive sections
- Avoid promotional language in headings

### Include Code Examples

When showcasing the month's key features:

```yaml title="promptfooconfig.yaml"
# Example showing major new capabilities from the month
redteam:
  plugins:
    - new-plugin-from-this-month
  strategies:
    - new-strategy
```

### Link to Resources

- Link to relevant documentation for featured capabilities
- Include GitHub issue/Pull Request numbers for major features when relevant
- Reference specific version numbers within the roundup text
- Cross-link between monthly roundups for feature evolution stories

### Cross-Month Continuity

Include references to feature progression using neutral language:

```markdown
:::info

The validation command builds on March's model scanner, creating a comprehensive quality assurance toolkit.

:::
```

### Performance Claims

Include specific metrics when mentioning performance improvements:

- "Improved performance for large datasets with server-side pagination"
- "Enhanced memory usage across WebUI components"
- "X major releases in Y days" statistics

## Best Practices

### SEO Optimization

- Write descriptive titles with clear feature focus ("March 2025: Multimodal Security Features")
- Keep descriptions under 160 characters for optimal search results
- Use relevant tags that group related months and features
- Include keywords naturally in the content
- Add structured data with proper categories

### Community Focus

- Thank contributors by name with GitHub links for major features
- Highlight community-requested features across multiple releases
- Include links to community resources (Discord, GitHub)
- Show progression on long-running community requests
- Aggregate community contributions across the month

### Monthly Narrative

- **Create clear themes** that tie the month's releases together
- **Show feature evolution** across multiple releases
- **Focus on practical benefits** that the cumulative changes enable
- **Include actionable next steps** for users

### Navigation Structure

End each roundup with cross-references:

```markdown
---

**Previous Roundups**: [March 2025](/releases/march-2025-roundup) • [April 2025](/releases/april-2025-roundup)  
**Next**: [June 2025](/releases/june-2025-roundup) • July 2025 Roundup (coming soon)
```

## Publishing Process

1. **Collect release data** from all releases during the target month
2. **Create thematic narrative** that ties releases together
3. **Create the monthly roundup file** in this directory following naming convention
4. **Add high-quality banner image** to `/static/img/releases/` (optional)
5. **Review for accuracy** - verify all mentioned features exist in codebase
6. **Commit and push** to the main branch
7. **The roundup will automatically appear** at `/releases/`

## Monthly Timing

- **Publish monthly roundups** within the first few days of the following month
- **Use the last day of the month** as the date in filename and front matter
- **Cover all releases** that were tagged during that calendar month

## RSS Feed

Monthly roundups are automatically included in the RSS feed at `/releases/rss.xml`, allowing users to subscribe to monthly updates.

## Authors

Update the `authors.yml` file to add new team members who will be authoring monthly roundups. Current authors available:
