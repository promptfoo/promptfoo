## Design Principles

- Focus on atomic design, building components with reusability and composability in mind.
- When possible, keep components small.
- Break out repeated patterns into reusable components to improve consistency.
- Follow the principles of atomic design
  - Reusability: Design small, composable parts with clear boundaries and APIs.
  - Consistency: Use design tokens (color, spacing, type) and shared patterns.
  - Single responsibility: Each component does one thing well; variants are explicit.
  - Composition over inheritance: Build complex UIs by assembling simpler pieces.
  - Clear naming and documentation: Predictable names, usage guidelines, and examples.

## Iconography

- Use icons from @mui/icons-material
- NEVER USE EMOJIS.
- Prefer commonly used icons from @mui/icons-material for intuitive experience.
