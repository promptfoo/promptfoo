## Action Items from Code Review

### Completed in this PR

- ✅ Reverted accidental G-Eval prompt changes that would have broken functionality
- ✅ Fixed provider detection to include OpenAI responses API
- ✅ Refactored to use explicit default providers instead of runtime capability detection
- ✅ Fixed logic to properly check for web search capabilities before using a provider
- ✅ Added comprehensive integration tests for matchesResearchRubric

### Immediate Actions Required

- [x] Add integration tests for matchesResearchRubric
- [x] Update documentation to emphasize cost implications more strongly

### Follow-up Tasks

- [x] Complete blog post "When LLM-Rubric Is Not Enough"
- [ ] Monitor usage and costs in production
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting for expensive operations
- [x] Add provider-specific documentation for web search configuration (OpenAI, Google, Perplexity, xAI all have web search docs)
- [ ] Consider creating an OpenAiResponsesProvider class to properly support web_search tools
- [ ] Add Perplexity and xAI to default providers when their API keys are present

## Overview

Implement a new `research-rubric` assertion type that can verify the accuracy of any output by using web search capabilities of supported LLM models. This goes beyond subjective evaluation to verify:

- Real-time information (weather, stock prices, current events)
- Mathematical calculations and facts
- Citations and references
- Any other verifiable claims

## Core Components

### 1. New Assertion Type: `research-rubric`

- **Location**: `src/assertions/researchRubric.ts`
- **Purpose**: Verify accuracy of outputs using web search
- **Key Features**:
  - Extracts all verifiable claims from outputs
  - Uses provider web search to verify each claim
  - Returns verification results with confidence levels
  - Falls back to standard llm-rubric if no web search available

### 2. Research Agent Matcher

- **Location**: `src/matchers.ts` - add `matchesResearchRubric`
- **Functionality**:
  - Extract verifiable claims (not just citations)
  - Orchestrate web searches for verification
  - Compile results with confidence scoring
  - Support different types of claims (facts, current info, calculations, citations)

### 3. Default Research Provider

- **Location**: `src/providers/defaults.ts`
- **Purpose**: Auto-select best provider for research tasks
- **Priority Order**:
  1. OpenAI responses API with web_search tool
  2. Google/Gemini models with googleSearch
  3. xAI models with search_parameters
  4. Fallback to regular llm-rubric if no search available

### 4. Provider Enhancements

- **OpenAI**: Already supports web_search via responses API
- **Google/Gemini**: Already supports googleSearch/googleSearchRetrieval
- **xAI**: Already supports search_parameters
- **Anthropic**: Would need external tool integration (future enhancement)

## Technical Considerations

### Design Update Summary

The `research-rubric` has been redesigned from a citation-focused tool to a general-purpose accuracy verification tool that can:

- Verify real-time information (weather, stock prices, news)
- Check mathematical calculations
- Validate historical facts and statistics
- Verify citations and academic references
- Confirm any other verifiable claims

This makes it much more broadly useful than just checking if papers exist.

### Provider-Specific Implementation Details

#### OpenAI Responses API

- Use `tools: [{ type: 'web_search' }]` configuration
- Parse search results from response metadata
- Handle rate limits and costs
- Note: The responses API uses a different provider format than regular chat

#### Google/Gemini

- Use `tools: [{ googleSearch: {} }]` configuration
- Access `groundingMetadata` from response
- Consider search grounding requirements

#### xAI/Grok

- Use `search_parameters: { mode: 'on', return_citations: true }`
- Parse citations from response
- Handle live search limitations

### Scoring Algorithm

1. Extract all citations/claims from output
2. For each citation:
   - Search for verification
   - Score based on evidence found
   - Weight by citation importance
3. Calculate overall score:
   - Percentage of verified citations
   - Quality of evidence
   - Handling of unverifiable claims

### Error Handling

- Provider doesn't support web search
- Search API rate limits
- Network failures
- Ambiguous citations
- Timeout handling

### Performance Optimizations

- Batch citation searches when possible
- Cache search results
- Parallel search execution
- Smart timeout management

## Future Enhancements

1. **Anthropic Integration**: Add web search via external tools/MCP
2. **Custom Search Providers**: Support Google Custom Search, Bing, etc.
3. **Advanced Citation Formats**: Handle DOIs, arXiv IDs, ISBN
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Return confidence levels for verifications
5. **Source Ranking**: Prioritize authoritative sources
6. **Multi-language Support**: Verify citations in different languages
7. **OpenAI Responses Provider**: Create proper provider class for responses API
8. **Perplexity/xAI Default Providers**: Add when API keys are detected

## Success Criteria

- [x] Research-rubric assertion type is fully functional
- [x] Works with OpenAI, Google, and xAI providers
- [x] Comprehensive documentation and examples
- [ ] > 90% test coverage (pending integration tests)
- [x] Performance is acceptable (<10s for typical verification)
- [x] Graceful degradation when search unavailable

## Notes

- Priority is OpenAI responses API since it has the most mature web search
- Consider cost implications of web search APIs
- May need rate limiting for expensive operations
- Should provide clear feedback about what was/wasn't verified
- The OpenAI responses API requires a different provider format than regular chat API
- Default research providers are loaded dynamically based on available API keys
