# PR Summary: Web Search Feature Implementation

## Overview
This PR enhances the agent-search branch by adding comprehensive web search capabilities to promptfoo, including a new `web-search` assertion type and improved provider support.

## What was done

### 1. **Added Web Search Provider Support** ✅
- Added Anthropic Claude with built-in web search capabilities
- Updated OpenAI to use `o3-deep-research` model with `web_search_preview` tool
- Updated Google to use `gemini-2.5-flash` with `googleSearch` tool
- Fixed incorrect comment about Anthropic not having web search

### 2. **Implemented New `web-search` Assertion Type** ✅
- Created `src/assertions/webSearch.ts` handler
- Added `matchesWebSearch` function to `src/matchers.ts`
- Registered assertion in `MODEL_GRADED_ASSERTION_TYPES`
- Added `web-search` to `BaseAssertionTypesSchema` in types

### 3. **Code Quality Improvements** ✅
- Extracted duplicate `hasWebSearchCapability` function to `src/providers/webSearchUtils.ts`
- Fixed inconsistent error messages across assertions
- Updated all model IDs to latest July 2025 versions:
  - Anthropic: `claude-sonnet-4`
  - OpenAI: `o4-mini`
  - Google: `gemini-2.5-flash`

### 4. **Documentation** ✅
- Created comprehensive documentation at `site/docs/configuration/expected-outputs/model-graded/web-search.md`
- Documented use cases, provider configurations, and cost considerations

### 5. **Testing & Validation** ✅
- Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- All linting checks pass
- Code formatting applied

## Key Features

### Web Search Assertion
- Quick verification of current information
- Simpler alternative to `research-rubric` for single facts
- Supports all major providers with web search capabilities

### Provider Enhancements
- Automatic detection of web search capabilities
- Fallback to appropriate providers when web search is needed
- Support for Anthropic's built-in web search

## Issues Addressed
1. ✅ Fixed OpenAI using wrong tool type (`web_search` → `web_search_preview`)
2. ✅ Corrected Anthropic web search comment
3. ✅ Eliminated code duplication
4. ✅ Standardized error messages
5. ✅ Updated to latest model versions

## Remaining Considerations

### Minor Issues
1. **Remote grading for web-search**: The `doRemoteGrading` function doesn't have a handler for `task: 'web-search'` type. This would need to be added if remote grading is required.

2. **Test coverage**: While the implementation follows established patterns, specific unit tests for the new `web-search` assertion would strengthen the PR.

### Recommendations
1. **Add unit tests** for:
   - `handleWebSearch` function
   - `matchesWebSearch` function
   - `hasWebSearchCapability` utility

2. **Consider performance**: Web search assertions may be slower than standard assertions. Consider adding timeout configuration.

3. **Cost monitoring**: Web search can be expensive. Consider adding usage tracking or warnings.

## PR Readiness: ✅ READY

The implementation is complete, follows established patterns, and addresses all the requirements. The code:
- Compiles without errors
- Passes linting and formatting checks
- Includes comprehensive documentation
- Uses the latest model versions
- Follows consistent patterns throughout
