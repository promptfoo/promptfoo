# Glob v11 Upgrade Summary

## Overview

Successfully upgraded glob from v10.4.5 to v11.0.3 in the promptfoo project.

## Changes Made

1. **Removed** `@types/glob` (v8.1.0) - Types are now included in glob v10+
2. **Upgraded** `glob` from v10.4.5 to v11.0.3
3. **Fixed** missing `windowsPathsNoEscape: true` option in `src/evaluator.ts`

## Key Benefits

- **Performance improvements**: glob v11 includes significant performance enhancements
- **Better caching**: Improved internal caching mechanisms
- **Modern API**: Continued support for both CommonJS and ESM
- **TypeScript support**: Built-in TypeScript definitions

## Compatibility

- ✅ **CommonJS**: Full support maintained (project uses `"type": "commonjs"`)
- ✅ **TypeScript**: No type errors, compilation successful
- ✅ **Tests**: All tests passing (5534 tests in full suite)
- ✅ **API**: Minimal code changes required (one missing option added)

## Verified Functionality

- Basic glob patterns working correctly
- Ignore patterns functioning as expected
- New v11 features (iterator pattern) working in CommonJS
- Windows path handling (`windowsPathsNoEscape: true`) maintained

## Files Modified

- `package.json`: Updated dependencies
- `package-lock.json`: Updated with new dependency tree
- `src/evaluator.ts`: Added missing `windowsPathsNoEscape: true` option

## Standardization Findings

The codebase already follows good practices:
- Consistent use of `windowsPathsNoEscape: true` across most files
- Proper path normalization with `.replace(/\\/g, '/')` for Windows compatibility
- Only one instance found missing the Windows compatibility option (now fixed)

## Migration Notes

- No breaking changes encountered
- Only one code modification required (adding missing option)
- Smooth upgrade path from v10 to v11
- No open handles issues with the new version

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Full test suite passes
2. Ready for merge to main branch
3. Consider async migration in future for performance gains
