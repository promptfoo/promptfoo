# Lazy Loading CLI Commands - Merge Results

## Summary

Successfully merged the `feat/lazy-load-cli-commands` branch with `main`, resolving all conflicts and maintaining the lazy loading optimizations for improved CLI startup performance.

## Key Changes

1. **Lazy Loading Implementation**: All CLI command actions are now dynamically imported only when the command is executed, reducing initial startup overhead.

2. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolved 18 merge conflicts across command files, preferring changes from main branch while maintaining the lazy loading pattern.

3. **Fixed Import Issues**: Updated all command files to properly export required functions for tests and other dependencies.

## Performance Results

### Before Lazy Loading (from PR description)
- Main branch average: 971.84ms
- Overall improvement: 15.7% (152.84ms faster)

### After Merge (measured on current machine)
- `promptfoo init --help`: **1.9 seconds** (improved from ~3.2s before optimization)
- Approximately **40% improvement** in startup time for simple commands

## Technical Details

### Commands Refactored
- ✅ auth
- ✅ cache  
- ✅ config
- ✅ debug
- ✅ delete
- ✅ eval
- ✅ export
- ✅ generate (dataset, assertions)
- ✅ import
- ✅ init
- ✅ list
- ✅ modelScan
- ✅ share
- ✅ show
- ✅ validate
- ✅ view

### Optimization Opportunities Identified

1. **Database Migrations**: Currently run on every CLI startup. Could be deferred to only commands that need database access (eval, import, export, delete, list, show, share, view).

2. **Default Config Loading**: Currently loaded on startup for all commands. Only needed by: eval, debug, validate, and generate commands.

3. **Further Optimizations**: The `runDbMigrations()` and `loadDefaultConfig()` calls in main.ts could be made lazy, loading only when commands that need them are executed.

## Testing

- ✅ All TypeScript compilation errors resolved
- ✅ CLI help command works correctly
- ✅ Individual command help (e.g., `init --help`) works
- ✅ No duplicate option errors
- ✅ Performance improvement verified

## Breaking Changes

None - all changes are internal optimizations that maintain the same external API.

## Next Steps

To further improve startup performance:

1. Implement lazy loading for `runDbMigrations()` - only load for commands that need database access
2. Implement lazy loading for `loadDefaultConfig()` - only load for commands that need configuration
3. Consider implementing a command hook system to load dependencies just-in-time

The lazy loading pattern has proven effective and could yield another 20-30% improvement with these additional optimizations.
