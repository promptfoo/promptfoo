          "output": "Absolutely! Albert Einstein's work fundamentally changed the landscape of physics. His theory of relativity comprises two parts: special relativity and general relativity. \n\n1. **Special Relativity** (1905): This theory introduced the concept that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and that the speed of light is constant regardless of the motion of the light source or observer. One of its most famous outcomes is the equation \\( E=mc^2 \\), which expresses the idea that mass can be converted into energy and vice versa, underscoring the deep relationship between mass and energy.\n\n2. **General Relativity** (1915): This is a theory of gravitation that describes gravity not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass. It provided a new framework for understanding how massive objects influence the movement of other objects and the paths they take through space and time. General relativity has been confirmed through various experiments and observations, such as the bending of light around massive objects and the detection of gravitational waves.\n\nIn addition to these groundbreaking theories, Einstein made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, and the photoelectric effect, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His insights into the nature of light and photons also laid the groundwork for much of modern physics and technology, including lasers and semiconductors. \n\nEinstein's influence extends beyond just physics; his thoughts on philosophy, human rights, and education continue to inspire people around the world.",
