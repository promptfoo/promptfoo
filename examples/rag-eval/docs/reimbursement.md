**Acme Inc. - Reimbursement Policy**

At Acme Inc., we appreciate the efforts our team members put into conducting business on our behalf. We recognize that this often involves various expenses. To streamline the management and reimbursement of these expenses, we adhere to the following policy:

1. **Eligibility for Reimbursement**: Expenses that are eligible for reimbursement include, but are not limited to, travel (airfare, train, taxi, and car rental), meals, accommodation, conference fees, and other business-related expenses. Personal expenses are not eligible for reimbursement.

2. **Receipts Required**: Employees are required to provide original, itemized receipts for all expenses. Non-itemized receipts or credit card statements will not be accepted. For meal expenses, please include the names of all attendees and the specific business purpose.

3. **Pre-Approval**: Expenses exceeding $500 must be pre-approved by the employee's manager. All travel-related expenses, such as airfare, accommodation, and car rentals, need pre-approval, regardless of the amount.

4. **Reimbursement Submission Deadline**: Employees must submit their expense reports by the first business day of the month following the month in which the expense was incurred. For example, if an expense was incurred in October, the expense report should be submitted by the first business day of November.

5. **Reimbursement Processing Time**: Reimbursements will typically be processed within two weeks of the submission deadline.

6. **Non-Compliance**: Non-compliance with this policy may result in delayed or denied reimbursements. Repeated non-compliance may lead to disciplinary action.

7. **Policy Exceptions**: Any exceptions to this policy must be pre-approved by the Finance Department before the expense is incurred.

This policy serves to ensure fair treatment of all employees and appropriate use of company funds. If you have any questions regarding this policy or a specific expense, please reach out to the HR or Finance Department.
