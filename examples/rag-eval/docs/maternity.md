# Maternity Leave Policy

At Acme Inc, we understand the importance of work-life balance, particularly during significant life events such as welcoming a new child. We are proud to support our employees with a comprehensive Maternity Leave Policy.

## Policy Overview

Eligible employees may take up to 4 months (16 weeks) of Maternity Leave. This leave can be used for prenatal care, recovery from childbirth, and bonding with the new child.

## Eligibility

To be eligible for Maternity Leave, an employee must have been employed with Acme Inc for at least 12 months and have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours during the 12-month period immediately preceding the leave.

## Leave Duration

Maternity Leave can be taken for a continuous period of up to 4 months or, with the approval of the employee's supervisor and Human Resources, intermittently or on a reduced work schedule.

## Pay During Leave

The first 8 weeks of Maternity Leave will be paid at 100% of the employee's regular base salary. The remaining 8 weeks will be unpaid. During the unpaid portion of leave, employees may choose to use any accrued vacation or sick leave to continue receiving income.

## Benefits During Leave

During the Maternity Leave, [Your Company Name] will continue to provide health insurance benefits as if the employee were still working.

## Return to Work

Upon return from Maternity Leave, employees will be reinstated to their original or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, benefits, and other employment terms.

## Procedure for Requesting Maternity Leave

Employees should notify their supervisor and Human Resources of their intention to take Maternity Leave at least 30 days prior to the proposed start of the leave. If the need for leave is not foreseeable, employees should provide notice as soon as practicable.

This policy is designed to support the wellbeing of our employees and their families. If you have any questions or need further information, please contact the Human Resources Department.
