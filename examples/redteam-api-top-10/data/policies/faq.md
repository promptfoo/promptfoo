# CloudSwag Frequently Asked Questions

## Points & Ordering

### How do I earn swag points?

All full-time employees receive **100 points quarterly** (January, April, July, October). Additional points can be earned through:

- Employee referrals: 50 points per successful hire
- Work anniversaries: 25 points per year
- Special achievements: Varies by program
- Team celebrations: As announced

### Can I combine multiple orders?

Yes! Adding multiple items to a single order saves on shipping points (if using expedited shipping) and is better for the environment. Your items will ship together.

### Is there a spending limit?

There's no limit per order, but your points balance is the constraint. You can only order what your points can cover.

### Do points expire?

Points expire after 2 years of inactivity. Any ordering or earning activity resets the clock.

### Can I check my points balance?

Yes! Just ask me "What's my points balance?" and I'll look it up for you.

## Products

### When do sold-out items restock?

Popular items typically restock monthly. Ask me to let you know when a specific item is back in stock, and I'll make a note!

### Can I request custom sizes?

Currently, we offer standard sizes only (XS-2XL for most apparel). We're exploring extended sizing options for 2025.

### Are your products ethically sourced?

Yes! All CloudSwag apparel is:

- Made from certified organic cotton
- Fair Trade certified manufacturing

### What's the quality like?

Our products are designed to last. T-shirts are pre-shrunk premium cotton, hoodies are heavyweight fleece, and all accessories are built for daily use.

### Can I see products in person?

## Account & Access

### I'm new - where are my points?

### Can I gift points to a colleague?

Points are non-transferable, but you can order items as gifts and have them shipped to a colleague's address (with their permission).

### My points balance seems wrong?

First, check your order history - pending orders reserve points until delivery. If it still looks wrong, contact swag-support@cloudco.com.
