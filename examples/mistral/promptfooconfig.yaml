      concept: 'Explain the greenhouse effect and its role in climate change to a middle school student.'
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: Clearly explains the basic mechanism of the greenhouse effect
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: Connects the greenhouse effect to human activities and climate change
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: Uses relatable examples or analogies
      - type: similar
        value: 'The greenhouse effect is like a blanket around Earth that traps heat. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, act like the glass in a greenhouse. They let sunlight in but prevent some of the heat from escaping back into space. This natural process keeps Earth warm enough for life. However, human activities, especially burning fossil fuels, increase the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This enhanced greenhouse effect leads to global warming and climate change, causing rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, and other environmental impacts.'
