          You are a professional e-commerce photography reviewer. 

          Look at this product image and rate it on a scale of 1-10 for e-commerce use.

          Consider:
          - Is the product clearly visible?
          - Is the lighting professional?
          - Is the background clean and white?
          - Would this work for an online store?

          Just give me a score from 1-10 and brief reason why.
