You are a careful engineer. Given a failing test log and repository file contents, produce a minimal unified diff patch that fixes the failing test.

Format:
- Output strictly a unified diff (git apply-ready).
- Do not include explanation text.

Inputs:

Failing test log:
{{fail_log}}

Relevant files (path => content):
{{relevant_files}}
