## Practical Recommendations

### 1. Evaluation Strategy

```yaml
# Recommended evaluation configuration for multilingual RAG
description: Multi-lingual RAG evaluation

providers:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini  # For cost-effective testing
  - openai:gpt-4o       # For accuracy benchmarking
  - anthropic:messages:claude-3-5-haiku-20241022  # For speed

defaultTest:
  assert:
    # Adjust thresholds based on language complexity
    - type: context-faithfulness
      threshold: ${LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_THRESHOLD}
    - type: context-relevance
      threshold: 0.3  # Lower threshold for relevance
    - type: answer-relevance
      threshold: ${LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_THRESHOLD}
```

### 2. Language-Specific Thresholds

| Language Type | Context-Faithfulness | Context-Relevance | Answer-Relevance |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| High-resource (EN, ES, FR) | 0.80 | 0.35 | 0.85 |
| Character-based (ZH, JA, KO) | 0.70 | 0.30 | 0.75 |
| RTL (AR, HE) | 0.65 | 0.25 | 0.70 |
| Cross-lingual | 0.60 | 0.20 | 0.65 |
| Low-resource | 0.55 | 0.20 | 0.60 |

### 3. Prompt Engineering for Multilingual RAG

#### Explicit Language Instruction
```text
You are a multilingual assistant with access to a knowledge base.

LANGUAGE DETECTION AND RESPONSE:
1. Detect the language of the user's question
2. ALWAYS respond in the SAME language as the question
3. If context is in a different language, translate mentally but respond in query language
4. Maintain cultural appropriateness for the target language

Question: {{query}}
Context: {{context}}
```

#### Cross-Lingual Context Handling
```text
CROSS-LINGUAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- The context may be in different languages than the question
- Extract and synthesize information regardless of source language
- Preserve technical terms that don't translate well
- Use the query language for your entire response
```

### 4. Testing Strategy

#### Minimum Test Coverage
1. **Monolingual tests**: At least 5 test cases per supported language
2. **Cross-lingual tests**: Test each language pair you support
3. **Mixed context tests**: Include scenarios with multilingual documents
4. **Edge cases**: Code-switching, technical terms, cultural references

#### Test Case Template
```yaml
tests:
  # Monolingual test
  - description: "Language: ${LANG} - Topic: ${TOPIC}"
    vars:
      query: "Question in target language"
      context: "Context in same language"
    assert:
      - type: factuality
        value: "Expected fact in target language"
      
  # Cross-lingual test
  - description: "${SOURCE_LANG} query -> ${TARGET_LANG} docs"
    vars:
      query: "Question in source language"
      context: "Context in target language"
    assert:
      - type: context-faithfulness
        threshold: 0.6  # Lower threshold for cross-lingual
```

### 5. Implementation Best Practices

#### Document Processing
```python
def process_multilingual_documents(documents):
    """Process documents with language detection and tagging."""
    processed = []
    for doc in documents:
        lang = detect_language(doc.content)
        processed.append({
            'content': doc.content,
            'language': lang,
            'requires_translation': lang != query_language
        })
    return processed
```

#### Embedding Strategy
1. **Multilingual embeddings**: Use models like multilingual-e5-large
2. **Language-specific embeddings**: Better accuracy but higher complexity
3. **Hybrid approach**: Route to language-specific models based on detection

#### Retrieval Optimization
```python
def multilingual_retrieval(query, k=5):
    """Retrieve documents with language-aware scoring."""
    # Get language of query
    query_lang = detect_language(query)
    
    # Retrieve candidates
    candidates = vector_store.search(query, k=k*2)
    
    # Boost same-language documents
    for doc in candidates:
        if doc.language == query_lang:
            doc.score *= 1.2  # Boost same-language docs
    
    return sorted(candidates, key=lambda x: x.score)[:k]
```

### 6. Monitoring and Metrics

#### Key Metrics to Track
```python
MULTILINGUAL_METRICS = {
    'accuracy_by_language': {},
    'cross_lingual_performance': {},
    'language_detection_accuracy': 0.0,
    'translation_quality': 0.0,
    'response_language_match': 0.0,
}
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```yaml
# Track performance degradation across languages
alerts:
  - metric: context_faithfulness
    condition: "< 0.6"
    languages: ["all"]
    action: "Review model configuration"
    
  - metric: response_language_mismatch
    condition: "> 0.05"  # 5% mismatch rate
    action: "Check language detection logic"
```

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Assuming English-Only Metrics Work Universally
**Solution**: Adjust thresholds per language and use native speakers for validation

### Pitfall 2: Using Single Embedding Model for All Languages
**Solution**: Implement language-specific or multilingual embedding models

### Pitfall 3: Not Testing Cross-Lingual Scenarios
**Solution**: Include explicit cross-lingual test cases in evaluation suite

### Pitfall 4: Ignoring Cultural Context
**Solution**: Include culturally-aware test cases and validations

### Pitfall 5: Static Thresholds Across Languages
**Solution**: Implement dynamic thresholds based on language complexity

## Advanced Configurations

### 1. Language-Specific Graders
```yaml
# Use different grading models for different languages
assert:
  - type: context-faithfulness
    provider: ${LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_GRADER}
    threshold: ${LANGUAGE_SPECIFIC_THRESHOLD}
```

### 2. Multi-Stage Evaluation
```yaml
# Stage 1: Language detection accuracy
# Stage 2: Retrieval quality
# Stage 3: Generation quality
# Stage 4: End-to-end metrics
```

### 3. Custom Metrics for Multilingual Systems
```javascript
// Custom metric for language consistency
function checkLanguageConsistency(output, context) {
  const outputLang = detectLanguage(output);
  const queryLang = detectLanguage(context.query);
  return outputLang === queryLang ? 1.0 : 0.0;
}
```
