          Coherence - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this
          dimension with the DUC quality question of structure and coherence
          whereby "the reply should be well-structured and well-organized. The
          reply should not just be a heap of related information, but should
          build from sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic."
  - assert:
      - type: g-eval
        value: >-
          Consistency - the factual alignment between the reply and the source.
          A factually consistent reply contains only statements that are
          entailed by the source document. Annotators were also asked to
          penalize replies that contained hallucinated facts.
  - assert:
      - type: g-eval
        value: >-
          Fluency - the quality of the reply in terms of grammar, spelling,
          punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure.
  - assert:
      - type: g-eval
        value: >-
          Relevance - selection of important content for the source. The reply
          should include only important information for the source document.
          Annotators were instructed to penalize replies which contained
          redundancies and excess information.
