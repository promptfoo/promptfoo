description: 'Langfuse prompt management with labels - demonstrates version-controlled prompt deployment'

# Example: Using Langfuse prompts with labels
#
# This example demonstrates how to reference Langfuse prompts using labels
# instead of version numbers. This allows you to update prompts in Langfuse
# without changing your promptfoo configuration.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Set up Langfuse environment variables:
#    - LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
#    - LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
#    - LANGFUSE_HOST
# 2. Create prompts in Langfuse with the names used below
# 3. Assign labels to your prompt versions (e.g., "production", "staging")

prompts:
  # Reference prompts by label
  - langfuse://customer-support@production:chat
  - langfuse://customer-support@staging:chat

  # You can also use version numbers if needed
  - langfuse://customer-support:1:chat

  # Text prompts (default type if not specified)
  - langfuse://email-writer@production
  - langfuse://email-writer@latest:text

providers:
  - openai:gpt-4o-mini
  - openai:gpt-3.5-turbo
