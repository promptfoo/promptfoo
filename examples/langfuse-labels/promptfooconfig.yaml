description: 'Langfuse prompt management with labels - demonstrates version-controlled prompt deployment'

# Example: Using Langfuse prompts with labels
#
# This example demonstrates how to reference Langfuse prompts using labels
# instead of version numbers. This allows you to update prompts in Langfuse
# without changing your promptfoo configuration.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Set up Langfuse environment variables:
#    - LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY
#    - LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY
#    - LANGFUSE_HOST
# 2. Create prompts in Langfuse with the names used below
# 3. Assign labels to your prompt versions (e.g., "production", "staging")

prompts:
  # Reference prompts by label using @ syntax (explicit)
  - langfuse://customer-support@production:chat
  - langfuse://customer-support@staging:chat

  # Reference prompts by label using : syntax (auto-detected)
  - langfuse://customer-support:production:chat # String detected as label
  - langfuse://customer-support:staging:chat # String detected as label

  # You can still use version numbers (numeric values)
  - langfuse://customer-support:1:chat # Numeric detected as version

  # Text prompts with labels (both syntaxes work)
  - langfuse://email-writer@production # @ syntax
  - langfuse://email-writer:latest:text # : syntax (latest treated as label)
  - langfuse://email-writer:production # : syntax (auto-detected as label)

tests:
  - vars:
      customer_name: 'Alice Johnson'

  - vars:
      customer_name: 'Bob Smith'
      issue: "My order hasn't arrived yet"
      company: 'Acme Corp'
      tone: 'empathetic and helpful'

# Default assertions that apply to all tests

      value: "The response should be {{tone}} and address the customer's issue: {{issue}}"
