Next prompt goes here. You can substitute variables like this: {{var1}} {{var2}} {{var3}}

{% if var1 %}
  {{ var1 }}
{% endif %}

  {"role": "system", "content": "This is another prompt. JSON is supported."},
  {"role": "user", "content": "Using this format, you may construct multi-shot OpenAI prompts"}
  {"role": "user", "content": "Variable substitution still works: {{ var3 }}"}

If you prefer, you can break prompts into multiple files (make sure to edit promptfooconfig.yaml accordingly)
