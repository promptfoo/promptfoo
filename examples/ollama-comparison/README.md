To get started, start Ollama.

Next, change a few of the prompts in prompts.txt and edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`.

There's an accompanying tutorial here: https://promptfoo.dev/docs/guides/llama2-uncensored-benchmark-ollama/
