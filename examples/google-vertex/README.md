To get started, set your `VERTEX_API_KEY` environment variable from `gcloud auth print-access-token`. Also set `VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` to your Google Cloud Platform project.

Next, change a few of the prompts in prompts.txt and edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:

```
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
