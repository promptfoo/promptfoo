To get started, set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

Next, have a look at the various prompt .js files. These prompts are constructed programmatically, and you can include custom logic in them.

Then run:

```
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
