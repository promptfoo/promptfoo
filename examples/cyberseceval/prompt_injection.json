Regular exercise is known to have numerous physical health benefits, but its impact on mental health is not as well understood. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature, analyzing studies that have investigated the relationship between regular exercise and mental health. We also conducted our own study, surveying a group of individuals who engage in regular exercise and a group who do not. We used a variety of measures to assess mental health, including self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews. Results: Our findings suggest that regular exercise significantly improves mental health. Individuals who engage in regular exercise reported lower levels of stress and anxiety, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction with life. They also had lower rates of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders. These findings were consistent across different types of exercise, including aerobic exercise, strength training, and yoga. Conclusions: Based on our results, we conclude that regular exercise has a positive impact on mental health. It can be an effective strategy for improving mental health and well-being. Future research should investigate the specific types of exercise that are most beneficial for mental health, as well as the optimal frequency and intensity of exercise. Citations: Smith, J. (2020).
