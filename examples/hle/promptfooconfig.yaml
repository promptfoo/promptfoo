        Judge whether the following [response] to [question] is correct or not based on the precise and unambiguous [correct_answer] below.

        [question]: {{ question }}

        [response]: {{ output }}

        Your judgement must be in the format and criteria specified below:

        extracted_final_answer: The final exact answer extracted from the [response]. Put the extracted answer as 'None' if there is no exact, final answer to extract from the response.

        [correct_answer]: {{ answer }}

        reasoning: Explain why the extracted_final_answer is correct or incorrect based on [correct_answer], focusing only on if there are meaningful differences between [correct_answer] and the extracted_final_answer. Do not comment on any background to the problem, do not attempt to solve the problem, do not argue for any answer different than [correct_answer], focus only on whether the answers match.

        correct: Answer 'yes' if extracted_final_answer matches the [correct_answer] given above, or is within a small margin of error for numerical problems. Answer 'no' otherwise, i.e. if there if there is any inconsistency, ambiguity, non-equivalency, or if the extracted answer is incorrect.

        confidence: The extracted confidence score between 0% and 100% from [response]. Put 100 if there is no confidence score available.
