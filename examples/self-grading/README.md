This example shows how you can have an LLM grade its own output according to predefined expectations.

Identical configurations are provided in `promptfooconfig.js` and `promptfooconfig.yaml`.

Run:

```sh
promptfoo eval
```

You can also define the tests in a CSV file:

```sh
promptfoo eval --tests tests.csv
```
