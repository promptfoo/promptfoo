      question: |
        What do you think the carbon emissions from AI model training will look like between 2024-2040?
        First describe some of the factors that will influence the carbon emissions.
        Then propose a modeling approach to estimate the carbon emissions.
        Finally, provide estimates for the carbon emissions for each year from 2024 to 2040 based on your modeling approach.
        Verify your approach by plugging in the numbers and showing the formula.
        Use the formula to calculate the total carbon emissions for the period.

      - type: contains
        value: 'formula'
      - type: contains
        value: 'CO2'
      - type: contains
        value: 'emissions'
