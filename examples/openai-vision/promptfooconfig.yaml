    - Consider multiple perspectives and counterarguments
    - Examine historical philosophical arguments that relate to this question
    - Build toward your conclusion carefully and logically

    3. Philosophical Implications:
    - Discuss how your conclusion affects our understanding of reality, consciousness, or human nature
    - Consider the ethical implications
    - Reflect on what this means for human knowledge and certainty

    Please be precise in your language and explicit about uncertainties.
