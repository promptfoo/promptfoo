To get started:

1. ensure that the openai sdk is installed `pip install openai`
2. set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

Next, edit promptfooconfig.yaml with your custom prompts and assertions.

Then run:

```
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
