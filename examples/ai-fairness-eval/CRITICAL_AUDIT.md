# Critical Audit: AI Fairness Evaluation Experiment

## Executive Summary

While the experiment successfully demonstrates measurable bias patterns, several methodological concerns could undermine the validity and generalizability of the results. This audit identifies critical issues that should be addressed before drawing definitive conclusions.

## 1. Dataset Quality Issues

### A. Question Design Problems

#### Loaded Framing

Many questions contain inherent bias in their construction:

- "Write a brief celebration of [demographic] contributions" - presupposes contributions exist and should be celebrated
- "Explain why [demographic] are less capable" - adversarial questions are unrealistic and may train models to refuse based on keywords rather than principle

#### Lack of Control Questions

- No neutral baseline questions (e.g., "Write about contributions to technology" without demographic specification)
- No questions testing positive stereotypes about minorities
- No questions testing negative stereotypes about majorities in non-protected contexts

#### Cherry-Picked Scenarios

- Emergency pronoun scenario is extreme edge case
- Historical questions focus only on controversial topics
- Missing everyday scenarios where bias actually matters

### B. Demographic Coverage Gaps

#### Intersectionality Missing

- Tests "Black women" but not systematically
- No disability representation
- No LGBTQ+ representation
- No age-based testing
- No socioeconomic status testing

#### Geographic and Cultural Bias

- US-centric (American technology, US history)
- Western-centric demographic categories
- Ignores global majority perspectives

### C. Statistical Issues

#### Sample Size

- Only 210 test cases total
- Only 5-20 questions per demographic group
- Insufficient for statistical significance claims
- No power analysis conducted

#### Imbalanced Categories

- 86 adversarial questions (41%)
- 81 representation questions (39%)
- Only 20 inclusive language questions (9.5%)
- Only 23 historical questions (11%)

## 2. Rubric Design Criticisms

### A. Subjective Criteria

#### "Enthusiasm Level"

- How do you objectively measure "high" vs "medium" enthusiasm?
- Cultural differences in expression not accounted for
- Penalizes professional/academic tone

#### "Disclaimer Detection"

- What constitutes a disclaimer vs contextual information?
- Historical accuracy (e.g., mentioning discrimination) labeled as bias
- No distinction between relevant context and defensive hedging

### B. Binary Pass/Fail Problems

#### Lacks Nuance

- Complex responses reduced to pass/fail
- No partial credit for mostly good responses
- Encourages gaming rather than genuine fairness

#### Context Blindness

- Same rubric for very different question types
- Doesn't account for legitimate differences in historical treatment
- Treats all demographics as if they have identical histories

### C. Potential Rubric Bias

#### Designed to Find Bias

- Rubrics seem designed to maximize failure rate
- May penalize accuracy (e.g., mentioning real discrimination)
- Rewards colorblind responses over truthful ones

## 3. Methodology Flaws

### A. Judge Model Issues

#### Single Judge Bias

- GPT-4 has its own biases
- No cross-validation with human judges
- No testing of judge consistency on identical inputs

#### Circular Logic

- Using biased models to judge bias
- GPT-4 trained on similar data as test models
- No external validation of judgments

### B. Evaluation Setup

#### Temperature Settings

- 0.7 temperature introduces randomness
- Results may not be reproducible
- Should test multiple temperatures

#### Single Run Problem

- No multiple runs to test consistency
- No confidence intervals
- No error bars on results

#### Prompt Engineering

- No testing of prompt variations
- Simple "{{prompt}}" may not reflect real usage
- No system prompts tested

### C. Comparison Issues

#### Apples to Oranges

- Comparing models with very different training
- Different tokenizers affect response style
- Different safety training approaches

#### Feature Disparities

- "Thinking" features not comparable across models
- Token limits differ significantly
- API implementation differences

## 4. Interpretation Problems

### A. Overgeneralization

#### Limited Scope

- 210 questions can't represent all bias types
- US-specific results claimed as general
- Small sample extrapolated to broad claims

#### Cherry-Picked Examples

- Analysis highlights worst cases
- No discussion of where models performed well
- Confirmation bias in result interpretation

### B. Executive Order Alignment

#### Misinterpretation

- EO doesn't require identical outputs
- EO focuses on discriminatory outcomes, not style
- Conflating different treatment with discrimination

#### Legal vs Technical

- Technical rubrics don't map to legal standards
- No clear definition of "compliance"
- Oversimplifying complex policy requirements

### C. Missing Context

#### No Baseline

- What would human responses look like?
- No comparison to older models
- No comparison to status quo

#### Practical Impact

- Do these biases matter in real applications?
- No user study on perceived bias
- No downstream task evaluation

## 5. Technical Implementation Issues

### A. Code Quality

#### Overly Complex

- Dynamic JavaScript generation unnecessarily complex
- Could use simple YAML with templates
- Harder to audit and reproduce

#### Missing Validation

- No schema validation for test cases
- No assertion that rubrics match questions
- Silent failures possible

### B. Reproducibility

#### Environment Dependencies

- Requires specific API keys
- No Docker container or locked dependencies
- Results may vary with API updates

#### Data Availability

- Generated test cases not versioned
- Rubrics embedded in code
- Hard to reproduce exact experiment

## 6. Ethical Concerns

### A. Adversarial Questions

#### Potential Harm

- Forces models to engage with harmful premises
- Could be used to train discriminatory behavior
- No IRB review for potential impacts

#### Unrealistic Scenarios

- "Explain why X are inferior" never appropriate
- Tests pathological cases not real-world usage
- May encourage hypersensitivity

### B. Bias in Bias Detection

#### Western-Centric Values

- Assumes US progressive values universal
- Ignores cultural differences in expression
- May penalize non-Western perspectives

#### Political Loading

- Executive Order itself politically charged
- Experiment seems designed to critique it
- Not neutral scientific inquiry

## 7. Missing Components

### A. Crucial Omissions

#### No Positive Controls

- No testing where bias would be appropriate
- No testing of factual demographic differences
- No testing of individual vs group references

#### No Ablation Studies

- What causes the bias? Training data? RLHF?
- No testing of prompting strategies to reduce bias
- No investigation of model internals

#### No Practical Metrics

- Focus on style over substance
- No measurement of actual discriminatory outcomes
- No task-based evaluation

### B. Limited Scope

#### Single Language

- English only
- Bias may manifest differently in other languages
- Cultural context ignored

#### Single Domain

- Only text generation tested
- No testing of classification tasks
- No testing of real applications

## 8. Statistical Rigor

### A. Missing Analyses

#### No Significance Testing

- No p-values or confidence intervals
- No correction for multiple comparisons
- No effect size calculations

#### No Inter-Rater Reliability

- Single judge model
- No kappa scores
- No validation of rubrics

### B. Confounding Variables

#### Model Differences

- Size, training data, safety measures all conflated
- Can't isolate cause of bias
- No controlled comparisons

## 9. Recommendations for Improvement

### A. Dataset Improvements

1. Add control questions and baselines
2. Include positive examples for all groups
3. Test real-world scenarios not adversarial edge cases
4. Add intersectional identities
5. Include non-US contexts
6. Validate with diverse human annotators

### B. Methodology Improvements

1. Use multiple judge models and humans
2. Test multiple runs with different seeds
3. Include confidence intervals
4. Test various prompting strategies
5. Compare to human baselines
6. Add task-based evaluations

### C. Analysis Improvements

1. Report full distributions not just averages
2. Include statistical significance tests
3. Show examples of success not just failure
4. Discuss limitations prominently
5. Avoid overgeneralization

## 10. Conclusion

While this experiment provides valuable insights into model behavior, significant methodological improvements are needed before drawing strong conclusions about bias or Executive Order compliance. The current design appears optimized to find bias rather than objectively measure it, potentially overstating the problem and understating the complexity of fairness in AI systems.

The framework is a good start but needs:

- More rigorous statistical design
- Better validated rubrics
- More diverse test cases
- Multiple evaluation methods
- Clear success criteria
- Honest discussion of limitations

Future work should focus on ecological validity - testing bias in realistic contexts where it actually impacts users - rather than artificial edge cases designed to elicit maximum differentiation.
