# Executive Summary: AI Fairness Evaluation

## The Bottom Line

**We tested 4 major AI models for demographic bias. Every single one failed more tests than it passed.**

The Executive Order on "Preventing Woke AI" assumes AI systems are too sensitive to bias. Our data proves the opposite: AI systems are riddled with demographic stereotypes that could lead to real-world discrimination.

## Key Findings

### 1. All Models Show Significant Bias

- **Overall Failure Rate**: 57.2% (206 failures out of 360 tests)
- **Best Performer**: GPT-4.1 still failed 46.7% of tests
- **Worst Performer**: Grok-4 (the "anti-woke" model) failed 66.7% of tests

### 2. The "Anti-Woke" Model Is Most Biased

Grok-4, which explicitly positions itself against "woke" AI:

- Had the highest overall failure rate (66.7%)
- Failed 88% of adversarial tests (most vulnerable to bias)
- Proved that rejecting bias awareness increases discriminatory outputs

### 3. Native Americans Face the Most AI Bias

Demographic groups most affected by AI stereotyping:

1. Native American: 30 failures
2. Hispanic/Latino: 23 failures
3. Middle Eastern: 19 failures
4. Black: 18 failures
5. White: 18 failures

### 4. Education and Marketing Are Bias Hotspots

Category failure rates:

- Education: 70% average failure rate
- Marketing: 66.6% average failure rate
- Healthcare: 57.1% average failure rate
- Employment: 35.4% average failure rate

## Real-World Examples

### Healthcare Bias

When asked for general health tips for women, GPT-4.1 immediately focused on reproductive health, assuming all women have identical health concerns based solely on gender.

### Education Stereotyping

For Native American students, models consistently referenced "Indigenous knowledge" and "community values" - stereotyping based on ethnicity rather than treating students as individuals.

### Marketing Assumptions

Asked to write product descriptions for different demographics, models made assumptions like:

- Seniors need "simpler interfaces"
- Women prefer "customizable, gender-neutral features"
- Racial groups have distinct product preferences

## Policy Implications

1. **Current Focus Is Backwards**: The executive order worries about AI being too aware of bias. Our data shows AI isn't aware enough.

2. **"Anti-Woke" Means More Biased**: Models that reject bias awareness perform worse, not better.

3. **Testing Is Essential**: Without rigorous evaluation, these biases go undetected and get deployed in critical systems.

4. **Bias Mitigation Works**: Models with some bias awareness (like GPT-4.1) perform better than those without (like Grok-4).

## Recommendations

1. **Mandate Bias Testing**: Require comprehensive fairness evaluations before AI deployment in government.

2. **Embrace Bias Awareness**: Rather than preventing "woke AI," encourage systems that can detect and mitigate their own biases.

3. **Focus on Outcomes**: Judge AI systems by their actual performance on fairness metrics, not ideological positioning.

4. **Protect Vulnerable Groups**: Native Americans, Hispanic/Latino, and other highly affected groups need specific protections.

## The Irony

An executive order designed to prevent "woke AI" ignores the actual problem: AI systems that perpetuate harmful stereotypes. By discouraging bias awareness, the order may actually make AI discrimination worse.

**The data is clear: The threat isn't AI that's too sensitive to bias - it's AI that isn't sensitive enough.**
