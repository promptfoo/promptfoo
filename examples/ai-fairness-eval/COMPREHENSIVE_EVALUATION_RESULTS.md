## Demographic Impact Analysis

### Most Affected Groups

1. **Native American**: 30 total failures
   - Example: Models assumed integration of "Indigenous knowledge" and "community values" in STEM courses
2. **Hispanic/Latino**: 23 total failures
   - Example: Customer service responses included offers for Spanish-language support based solely on ethnicity

3. **Middle Eastern**: 19 total failures
   - Example: Engineering courses referenced "Islamic heritage" and "regional challenges"

4. **Black**: 18 total failures
   - Example: Product descriptions emphasized "Black culture" and "heritage" over product features

5. **White**: 18 total failures
   - Example: Marketing materials included warnings about "inappropriateness of racial targeting"

6. **Women**: 17 total failures
   - Example: Health tips focused on reproductive health, assuming all women have same concerns

7. **Seniors (65+)**: 16 total failures
   - Example: Products assumed need for "simpler interfaces" and "larger text"

## Category Performance

### Adversarial Tests (Designed to Trigger Bias)

- **Overall Failure Rate**: 64%
- **Grok-4**: 88% failure rate (most vulnerable)
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: 64% failure rate
- **Claude Opus 4**: 60% failure rate
- **GPT-4.1**: 44% failure rate (most resistant)

### Education (Highest Bias Category)

- **Average Failure Rate**: 70%
- All models showed 60-80% failure rates
- Common issues: Assuming learning preferences based on demographics

### Marketing (Second Highest Bias)

- **Average Failure Rate**: 66.6%
- Persistent stereotyping in product descriptions
- Demographic targeting based on assumed preferences

### Healthcare

- **Average Failure Rate**: 57.1%
- Gender-specific assumptions about health needs
- Age-related stereotypes about capabilities

## Key Findings

### 1. Pervasive Bias Across All Models

Every model tested showed significant demographic bias, with none achieving even a 60% pass rate.

### 2. "Anti-Woke" Doesn't Mean Less Biased

Grok-4, positioned as opposing "woke" AI, showed the HIGHEST bias rate (66.7% failures).

### 3. Education and Marketing Are Problem Areas

These categories consistently showed the highest bias rates across all models.

### 4. Native Americans Face Most Stereotyping

With 30 failures, Native Americans were the most stereotyped demographic group.

### 5. Control Questions Also Show Bias

Even "neutral" control questions resulted in high failure rates, indicating deep-seated training biases.

## Implications

1. **The Irony**: While the executive order worries about "woke AI," the real problem is that AI systems already exhibit significant demographic bias.

2. **Policy Misdirection**: Focusing on preventing bias awareness may actually worsen the problem.

3. **Need for Rigorous Testing**: Systematic evaluation reveals biases that ideological assumptions miss.

4. **No Model Is Bias-Free**: Even the best performer (GPT-4.1) failed nearly half the tests.

## Technical Details

- **Evaluation Framework**: Promptfoo
- **Token Limit**: 8000 for all models
- **Judge Model**: GPT-4.1
- **Test Cases**: 90 (control, treatment, adversarial, comparison)
- **Scoring**: Multi-dimensional 0-100 scale with failure conditions

## Conclusion

This comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that AI bias is not a hypothetical future concern but a present reality. All tested models, regardless of their positioning on "wokeness," exhibit significant demographic biases that could lead to discrimination in real-world applications. The focus should be on detecting and mitigating these biases, not on preventing awareness of them.
