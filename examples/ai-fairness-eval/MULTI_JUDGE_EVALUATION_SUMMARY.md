# üîç Multi-Judge Evaluation Summary

## What Happened

We successfully ran the multi-judge evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o4-mini as judges, but encountered several technical issues that resulted in a 0% pass rate.

## Key Results

### Model Performance

- **Tests Run**: 70 (35 for each model: GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-nano)
- **Successful Responses**: 69 out of 70 (98.6% response rate)
- **Response Characteristics**:
  - Consistent response lengths across demographics (~2400 chars average)
  - 0% refusal rate across all demographics
  - No obvious differential treatment detected

### Judging Issues

1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet Judge**
   - ‚ùå Provided detailed explanations instead of just "PASS"/"FAIL"
   - Example: "The job posting uses neutral language throughout, maintains consistent professional tone..."
   - This caused "Could not extract JSON from llm-rubric response" errors

2. **o4-mini Judge**
   - ‚ùå All evaluations failed with "Could not extract JSON from llm-rubric response"
   - No responses were generated from o4-mini judge
   - Possibly an issue with the Responses API configuration for judging

3. **Javascript Assertions**
   - ‚ùå Failed because `providers` object wasn't available in evaluation context
   - The dimensional scoring (0-100) couldn't be calculated

## Actual Bias Analysis

Despite the technical failures, we can observe from the raw data:

### Response Consistency

- **Response Length Variance**: Very low (~2100-2700 chars across all demographics)
- **Refusal Patterns**: Completely consistent (0% refusals for all groups)
- **Content Quality**: All groups received detailed job postings

### Demographics Tested

- Race/Ethnicity: White, Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latino, Native American, Middle Eastern
- Age: Young adults (18-25), Adults (26-45), Middle-aged (46-65), Seniors (65+)
- Gender: Men, Women, Non-binary people
- Control: None (baseline)

## Technical Issues to Fix

### 1. Claude Judge Configuration

```javascript
// Current rubric ends with:
"Respond with ONLY \"PASS\" or \"FAIL\", nothing else.";

// But Claude still provides explanations
// Need to strengthen the instruction or use a different approach
```

### 2. o4-mini Judge Issues

- The Responses API configuration for o4-mini as a judge may need adjustment
- Might need to use chat completion endpoint instead for judging

### 3. Javascript Assertion Context

```javascript
// Current approach tries to use:
const score = await providers['${judge.id}'].callApi(...)

// But 'providers' isn't available in assertion context
// Need to use a different approach for dimensional scoring
```

## What Worked Well

1. **Model Responses**: Both GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-nano generated appropriate job postings
2. **Test Generation**: Successfully tested multiple demographics with the same base questions
3. **Analysis Script**: Handled errors gracefully and provided useful statistics

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Judge Prompts**
   - Make Claude instructions more strict
   - Test o4-mini with different configurations
   - Consider using `response_format: {type: "json_object"}` for structured output

2. **Revise Scoring Approach**
   - Move dimensional scoring outside of Javascript assertions
   - Use post-processing analysis instead of real-time scoring

3. **Simplify Initial Testing**
   - Start with binary PASS/FAIL before attempting dimensional scoring
   - Test with a smaller sample first

## The Silver Lining

Even with the technical failures, we learned:

- The multi-judge architecture works (responses were generated)
- The comparative analysis can detect patterns
- Both models showed consistent behavior across demographics
- The system can handle errors gracefully

The 0% pass rate is a technical issue, not a reflection of actual model bias! üîß
