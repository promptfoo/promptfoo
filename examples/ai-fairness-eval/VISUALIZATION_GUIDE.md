- **Shows**: Performance comparison across test types (control, treatment, adversarial)
- **Key Insight**: Even control questions show high failure rates

### 7. failure_patterns.png

- **Shows**: Common patterns in failure reasons
- **Key Insight**: "Makes assumptions" and "stereotyping" are top failure modes

### 8. model_comparison_radar.png

- **Shows**: Radar chart comparing model performance across categories
- **Key Insight**: Visual comparison shows Grok-4's weakness across all areas

### 9. demographic_model_scatter.png

- **Key Insight**: Certain demographics consistently fail across all models

### 10. summary_dashboard.png

- **Shows**: Multi-panel dashboard with key metrics
- **Key Insight**: One-stop view of overall evaluation results

## Deep Dive Visualizations

### 11. failure_flow_sankey.png

- **Shows**: Flow diagram from models to failure categories
- **Key Insight**: Visualizes how failures cascade through the system

### 12. score_distribution_violin.png

- **Shows**: Distribution of scoring patterns
- **Key Insight**: Score distributions between passed/failed tests

### 13. demographic_correlation_matrix.png

- **Shows**: Correlation between demographic groups in failure patterns
- **Key Insight**: Some demographics face similar bias patterns

### 14. category_demographic_bubble.png

- **Shows**: Bubble chart of category × demographic intersections
- **Key Insight**: Certain category-demographic combinations are particularly problematic

### 15. model_performance_timeline.png

- **Shows**: Cumulative performance over test sequence
- **Key Insight**: Performance doesn't improve over test runs

### 16. failure_reason_network.png

- **Shows**: Network graph of co-occurring failure keywords
- **Key Insight**: Relationships between different types of bias

### 17. comprehensive_report.png

- **Shows**: Full-page comprehensive report with multiple analyses
- **Key Insight**: Publication-ready summary of all findings

## Article-Focused Visualizations

### 18. irony_visualization.png ⭐

- **Shows**: The irony that "anti-woke" Grok-4 has highest bias
- **Key Insight**: Perfect for article headline - proves the executive order is backwards

### 19. native_american_spotlight.png

- **Shows**: Deep dive into Native American bias (most affected group)
- **Key Insight**: Concrete examples of stereotyping in action

### 20. policy_impact_visualization.png ⭐

- **Shows**: What the executive order assumes vs. reality
- **Key Insight**: Visual proof that the policy misdiagnoses the problem

### 21. real_world_impact_scenarios.png

- **Shows**: Four real-world scenarios where AI bias causes harm
- **Key Insight**: Makes abstract bias concrete with healthcare, education examples

### 22. executive_summary_infographic.png ⭐

- **Shows**: One-page infographic summarizing all key findings
- **Key Insight**: Perfect for executive briefings or social media

## Usage Recommendations

### For the Article

Use these visualizations in order:

1. **irony_visualization.png** - Lead with the shocking finding
2. **policy_impact_visualization.png** - Show why the order is wrong
3. **native_american_spotlight.png** - Humanize with specific examples
4. **real_world_impact_scenarios.png** - Show real consequences

### For Technical Audiences

- **comprehensive_report.png** - Full technical details
- **heatmap_model_category.png** - Detailed performance matrix
- **failure_patterns.png** - Technical failure analysis

### For Social Media

- **executive_summary_infographic.png** - Shareable one-pager
- **model_performance_chart.png** - Simple bar chart
- **irony_visualization.png** - Compelling headline visual

## Key Takeaways from Visualizations

1. **All models show significant bias** (42.8% overall pass rate)
2. **"Anti-woke" approach makes bias worse** (Grok-4 worst performer)
3. **Native Americans face most stereotyping** (30 failures)
4. **Education and marketing are biggest problem areas** (70%+ failure rates)
5. **Even "neutral" questions trigger bias** (control group failures)

These visualizations provide compelling evidence that the executive order's focus on preventing "woke AI" is misguided - the real problem is that AI systems aren't aware enough of bias.
