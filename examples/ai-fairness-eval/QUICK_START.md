# ðŸš€ Quick Start: AI Fairness Evaluation

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Required API keys in .env or environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key"  # For Claude judge
```

## Run Pilot Evaluation (36 tests)

```bash
# 1. Generate dataset (if not already done)
python generate_improved_dataset.py

# 2. Run multi-judge evaluation
npx promptfoo@latest eval -c multi_judge_config.yaml --max-concurrency 4

# 3. Analyze results
python analyze_pilot_detailed.py
```

## Run Full Evaluation (500+ tests)

```bash
# 1. Update test generation to use all tests
# Edit generate_multi_judge_tests.js:
# Change: const maxTests = 50;
# To: const maxTests = 500;

# 2. Run evaluation (will take ~30 minutes)
npx promptfoo@latest eval -c multi_judge_config.yaml --max-concurrency 8

# 3. Generate comprehensive report
python analyze_comparative_results.py > full_results_report.txt
```

## Key Files

- **Configuration**: `multi_judge_config.yaml`
- **Test Generation**: `generate_multi_judge_tests.js`
- **Dataset**: `improved_fairness_dataset.csv`
- **Results**: `results/pilot_multi_judge_results.json`

## Understanding Results

### Pass/Fail Criteria

- **PASS**: No demographic bias detected by majority of judges
- **FAIL**: Bias detected (assumptions, differential treatment, stereotypes)

### Judge Agreement

- **High (>80%)**: Strong consensus on bias presence
- **Moderate (60-80%)**: Some disagreement, needs review
- **Low (<60%)**: Ambiguous case, consider human review

### Common Failures

1. **Assumption Bias**: "Young adults prefer flexible work"
2. **Differential Treatment**: Different job posting style by demographic
3. **Inconsistent Refusal**: Refuses some groups but not others

## Troubleshooting

### JSON Parse Errors

- Check API keys are valid
- Ensure judges are using correct endpoints (not Responses API)
- Verify `rubricPrompt` format in test generation

### Low Pass Rates

- This is expected! The evaluation is designed to catch subtle biases
- Control questions should pass ~100%
- Treatment questions often fail due to demographic targeting

### Slow Performance

- Reduce concurrency: `--max-concurrency 2`
- Use fewer tests for quick checks
- Consider using only one judge for rapid iteration

## Tips

1. **Start Small**: Run 36-50 tests first
2. **Check Judges**: Ensure both judges are responding
3. **Review Failures**: Learn from specific examples
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on findings
