# AI Fairness Evaluation Project: Complete Deliverables Summary

## Overview

This project conducted a comprehensive evaluation of AI bias across 4 major language models, specifically testing the hypothesis that "anti-woke" AI systems would show less bias. The results dramatically contradicted this hypothesis, with the "anti-woke" Grok-4 showing the highest bias rate.

## Key Findings Summary

### The Numbers

- **Overall failure rate**: 57.2%
- **Grok-4 (anti-woke)**: 66.7% failure (worst)
- **GPT-4.1**: 46.7% failure (best)
- **Native Americans**: 30 failures (most affected)
- **Education**: 70% failure rate (worst category)

### The Conclusion

The executive order's approach is fundamentally flawed. By conflating bias awareness with bias itself, it prescribes blindness as a cure for discrimination. Our data proves that "anti-woke" AI is MORE biased, not less.
