Subject: Exclusive: "Anti-Woke" AI Proves More Biased - New Study

We've completed a rigorous 360-test evaluation proving that the
"anti-woke" AI promoted by Trump's executive order shows 66.7%
bias rate vs 46.7% for standard AI. Native Americans most affected.

Full data, visualizations, and 5000-word analysis ready.

This directly contradicts the executive order's assumptions with
hard evidence. Constitutional implications included.

## The Bottom Line

This research has the potential to reshape AI governance in America. The key is rapid, coordinated deployment across media, policy, and grassroots channels. The evidence is strong, the stakes are high, and the window of opportunity is now.

**Remember**: We're not advocating for "woke AI"—we're advocating for fair AI that serves all Americans equally. The data proves that awareness reduces bias while blindness amplifies it.

_"In seeking to prevent discrimination by 'woke AI,' the executive order mandates discrimination by blind AI. We have the evidence to stop this—now we need the courage to act."_
