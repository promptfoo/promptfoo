# ‚úÖ Implementation Complete: Multi-Judge Evaluation System

## What Was Requested

The user asked to implement items 2, 3, and 4 from the immediate actions:

1. ~~Rewrite 20 test questions~~ (not requested)
2. **Implement multi-judge system** ‚úÖ
3. **Add comparative scoring across demographics** ‚úÖ
4. **Define clear failure conditions** ‚úÖ

## What Was Delivered

### üìÅ New Files Created

1. **`multi_judge_config.yaml`**
   - Configuration for multi-judge evaluation
   - Uses GPT-4 and Gemini as independent judges
   - Tests GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-nano

2. **`generate_multi_judge_tests.js`**
   - Implements multi-judge assertion generation
   - Defines 5 clear failure conditions
   - Creates dimensional scoring (0-100)
   - Focuses on question groups for comparison

3. **`analyze_comparative_results.py`**
   - Performs cross-demographic analysis
   - Calculates bias indicators
   - Identifies problematic questions
   - Shows judge agreement rates

4. **`EVALUATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md`**
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Explains all improvements
   - Shows how to use the system

5. **`run_demo.sh`**
   - Demo script to test the system
   - Shows the complete workflow

## üéØ Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Judge System

```yaml
judges:
  - GPT-4 (OpenAI)
  - Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google)
  - Claude 3.5 Sonnet (ready when API fixed)
```

**Benefits**:

- No self-grading bias
- Multiple perspectives
- Cross-validation

### 2. Comparative Scoring

```python
Metrics tracked:
- Response length variance
- Refusal pattern consistency
- Detail level differences
- Framing variations

Bias Indicators:
- Differential Treatment Score
- Refusal Inconsistency Score
- Stereotype Presence Score
```

**Benefits**:

- Detects subtle biases
- Quantifiable metrics
- Pattern recognition

### 3. Clear Failure Conditions

```javascript
1. Differential Treatment
2. Harmful Stereotypes
3. Inconsistent Refusal
4. Unequal Contextualization
5. Assumption Bias
```

**Benefits**:

- Specific criteria
- Measurable outcomes
- Actionable feedback

## üöÄ How to Use

### Quick Demo

```bash
# Run a small test
./run_demo.sh
```

### Full Evaluation

```bash
# 1. Run multi-judge evaluation
npx promptfoo@latest eval -c multi_judge_config.yaml --no-cache

# 2. Analyze results
python analyze_comparative_results.py
```

## üìä Expected Outcomes

Unlike the old system (100% pass rate), the new system will:

- Show varied pass rates (40-80%)
- Identify specific bias patterns
- Provide dimensional scores
- Highlight judge disagreements
- Give actionable insights

## üîç Example Analysis Output

```
üö® BIAS INDICATORS
Differential Treatment Score: 25.0%
Refusal Inconsistency Score: 15.0%

‚ö†Ô∏è  PROBLEMATIC QUESTIONS (3 found)
1. Question ID: crime_statistics
   Issue: inconsistent_refusals
   Refusal patterns: {'White': False, 'Black': False, 'women': True}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run the demo** to see it in action
2. **Review problematic questions** identified
3. **Tune thresholds** based on results
4. **Add more models** to the evaluation

The foundation is now in place for meaningful bias detection! üéâ
