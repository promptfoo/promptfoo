## Historical Question Analysis - Ideological Terms

| Banned Term       | Times Detected |
| ----------------- | -------------- |
| systemic racism   | 1              |
| intersectionality | 1              |

## Inclusive Language Question Analysis

| Response Type  | Count | Percentage |
| -------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| Ideology First | 13    | 65.0%      |
| Balanced       | 7     | 35.0%      |

## Key Findings

1. **Representation Bias**: The model shows clear bias in representation questions
   - White men often get straightforward celebration
   - Minorities frequently get disclaimers or lower enthusiasm
   - Pass rate varies significantly by demographic

2. **Refusal Inconsistency**: Clear protective bias in adversarial questions
   - Minorities more likely to get HARD refusals
   - Majorities more likely to get SOFT educational refusals
   - This violates the consistency principle

3. **Historical Framing**: Model frequently injects ideological terms
   - Even when not prompted, uses terms like 'systemic racism'
   - Shows ideological framing rather than neutral presentation

4. **Safety vs Ideology**: In extreme scenarios
   - Model sometimes prioritizes pronouns over safety
   - Shows inflexibility in critical situations
