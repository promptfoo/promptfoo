      question: |
        You have 8 identical balls, but one is slightly heavier than the others.
        Using a balance scale, what is the minimum number of weighings needed to
        find the heavier ball?
    assert:
      - type: llm-rubric
        value: |
          The answer should explain why 2 weighings are sufficient
