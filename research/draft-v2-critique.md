# Critique of Draft V2

## Overall Problems

### 1. No Narrative Thread
The draft reads like a reference document, not an article. It's organized by category (federal, state, international, technical) but there's no "so what" connecting these sections. A reader learns facts but doesn't understand why they matter together.

### 2. No Thesis
What's the one thing we want readers to take away? The draft doesn't have one. "Here's what happened" isn't a thesis—it's a table of contents.

### 3. Assumed Knowledge
The draft assumes readers already understand:
- Why AI regulation matters to them
- What compliance means in practice
- How federal and state law interact
- Why China is relevant to U.S. builders

### 4. Undefined Acronyms and Jargon
First use without definition:
- EO (Executive Order)
- OMB (Office of Management and Budget)
- DPA (Defense Production Act)
- FTC (Federal Trade Commission)
- FCC (Federal Communications Commission)
- DOJ (Department of Justice)
- SB, AB, HB (Senate Bill, Assembly Bill, House Bill)
- TRAIGA (not expanded at all)
- CAC (Cyberspace Administration of China)
- NCSC (National Cyber Security Centre, UK)
- OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)

### 5. Jargon Without Explanation
- "algorithmic discrimination" - what does this mean legally?
- "context compaction" - technical term not explained
- "extended thinking with interleaved tool use" - meaningless to non-specialists
- "public opinion attributes" - Chinese regulatory term, not explained
- "rights-impacting" vs "high-impact" - why does this distinction matter?

## Section-by-Section Issues

### Opening
> "This is a summary of what happened in AI policy in 2025..."

This is a label, not a hook. It tells readers what the document is, not why they should read it. No stakes established.

### U.S. Federal Picture
- The Biden/Trump comparison table is useful but drops readers into the middle without context
- "What Remained Consistent" section is good but buried
- December EO section reads like a legal brief—accurate but not explanatory
- No explanation of *why* preemption matters or what it means practically

### State Picture
- Table is dense and hard to parse
- "algorithmic discrimination" used without definition
- No explanation of why state laws exist or what problem they're trying to solve
- The preemption risk section makes assertions without explaining reasoning
- State AG response mentioned but significance not explained

### International Context
- China section is actually the clearest, but:
  - No explanation of why U.S. builders should care
  - "public opinion attributes" is regulatory jargon
- EU section is too brief to be useful—just dates with no substance

### Technical Context
- Model capabilities table is cryptic
- No explanation of why these capabilities matter for compliance
- Security section is disconnected from the rest—why is prompt injection relevant here?

### 2026 Timeline
- Useful for reference but no narrative value
- Just a list of dates without implications

### Implications for Builders
- "Documentation Requirements Are Increasing" — obvious from preceding sections
- "Testing Needs to Cover Systems, Not Just Models" — asserted but not explained
- "Uncertainty Is the Near-Term Condition" — vague and unhelpful

### Our Perspective
- Actually okay—honest and understated
- But disconnected from the rest; no bridge to it

## Writing Quality Issues

1. **Passive voice throughout.** "Was rescinded," "must be established." Bureaucratic tone.

2. **No examples.** Abstract requirements without concrete illustrations.

3. **Tables overused.** Good for reference, bad for reading flow.

4. **Monotonous structure.** Every section: topic sentence → facts → citation. Repetitive.

5. **No transitions.** Sections don't connect to each other.

## What's Missing

1. **Stakes** — Why should a builder care about any of this?
2. **Practical examples** — What does compliance actually look like?
3. **The "so what"** — What do these facts mean together?
4. **Enforcement reality** — What happens if you don't comply?
5. **A conclusion** — What should readers do with this information?

## Recommendations for V3

1. **Start with a thesis.** Something like: "In 2025, AI regulation became operational. Executive orders became contract requirements. That changes how you build."

2. **Define everything on first use.** Spell out acronyms. Explain jargon. Don't assume knowledge.

3. **Add transitions.** Explain why we're moving from federal to state to international. Show the connections.

4. **Use fewer tables, more prose.** Tables for reference at the end; prose for explanation in the body.

5. **Add concrete examples.** "If you're selling to the federal government, here's what you now need to provide..."

6. **Cut or expand international.** Either explain why it matters to the audience or remove it.

7. **Make implications specific.** Not "documentation is increasing" but "here's what documentation now means: X, Y, Z."

8. **Create a narrative arc.** Beginning: here's the situation. Middle: here's what changed. End: here's what it means for you.

9. **End with something actionable.** Not just "we're happy to talk" but specific next steps or questions to consider.
