# Defensible Predictions for AI Policy in 2026

Based on 2025 signals, here are 4 well-supported forecasts for AI policy in 2026. Each prediction cites at least one primary source from 2025.

## Prediction 1: Preemption Fights and Federal-State Litigation Accelerate

### The Signal

In 2026, expect an uptick in direct challenges to state AI laws, including preemption and constitutional claims, because the White House has already ordered the DOJ to stand up an **"AI Litigation Task Force"** whose sole job is to challenge "onerous" state AI laws. ([The White House][1])

The same 2025 order also sets up a pipeline for escalation:
- Commerce must publish an evaluation of state AI laws
- The administration contemplates tying discretionary funding to states agreeing not to enforce certain laws ([The White House][1])

### Why It Matters for 2026

In 2026, the biggest compliance risk may be **uncertainty**: laws on the books, enforcement paused or enjoined, and federal pressure to unify the landscape. ([The White House][1])

### What to Watch

- DOJ task force activity (case filings, amicus briefs, state attorney general negotiations)
- Commerce Department report on state AI laws
- Federal grant conditions tied to AI law enforcement
- State responses (defending laws, seeking injunctions against federal overreach)

## Prediction 2: Disclosure Becomes a Default Compliance Artifact, via Procurement and FCC Action

### The Signal

Expect "federal disclosure standards" to land first through **buying rules and procurement templates** rather than a single omnibus AI law.

**OMB 2025 AI acquisition memo** requires agencies, when practicable, to:
- Disclose in solicitations whether a planned AI use is (or is likely to be) "high-impact"
- Put vendors on notice about transparency and documentation requirements needed for compliance

**OMB 2025 federal AI use memo** requires agencies to:
- Inventory AI use cases annually
- Submit inventories to OMB
- Post a public version on their websites

**December 2025 Executive Order** directs the FCC to initiate a proceeding on a **"Federal reporting and disclosure standard for AI models"** that could preempt conflicting state laws. ([The White House][1])

**OMB December 2025 memo (M-26-04)** requires:
- Contractual requirements for new LLM procurements
- Specific deadline: **March 11, 2026** for agencies to update procurement policies accordingly

### Why It Matters for 2026

2026 is when documentation starts to look like "the standard," because vendors will need **reusable disclosure packets** (impact assessment inputs, testing evidence, monitoring hooks) to sell into government, and those artifacts tend to spill into private-sector audits and RFPs.

### What to Watch

- FCC rulemaking proceeding on federal AI disclosure standard
- Agency procurement policy updates by March 2026 deadline
- Standardization of model cards, system cards, and testing documentation across vendors
- Private-sector adoption of government-style disclosure formats

## Prediction 3: Child Safety Is the Most Durable Carve-Out, with 2026 Compliance Deadlines

### The Signal

Child safety is explicitly treated as a **protected category** in the administration's preemption posture: the December 2025 executive order says any federal preemption recommendation should not propose preempting otherwise lawful state laws relating to **"child safety protections."** ([The White House][1])

Meanwhile, Congress already enacted a targeted child safety and deepfake-adjacent law in 2025: the **TAKE IT DOWN Act** requires:
- Covered platforms to create a notice-and-removal process **within one year of enactment**
- Remove nonconsensual intimate visual depictions **within 48 hours** of receiving a valid request ([Congress.gov][2])

The Act also squarely covers AI-generated fakes by defining "digital forgery" as intimate depictions created through **"machine learning" or "artificial intelligence,"** among other means. ([Congress.gov][2])

### Why It Matters for 2026

Even if broader AI model regulation becomes a preemption battlefield, 2026 is set up to be an **implementation and enforcement year** for child-safety-driven obligations (and a politically safer lane for additional legislation). ([Congress.gov][2])

### What to Watch

- TAKE IT DOWN Act compliance deadlines (notice-and-removal processes)
- State child safety AI laws surviving preemption challenges
- Additional congressional action on AI and child safety (one of few bipartisan lanes)
- Platform enforcement patterns for AI-generated NCII

## Prediction 4: Regulation Keeps Shifting from Model-Level to System-Level (Use Cases, Lifecycle Controls)

### The Signal

The 2025 federal AI-use framework is organized around **"high-impact" *uses*** and mandates lifecycle controls:

| Requirement | Focus |
|-------------|-------|
| **AI impact assessment** | Must complete before deploying any high-impact AI use case, and update periodically across the AI lifecycle |
| **Pre-deployment testing** | Risk mitigation planning required |
| **Ongoing monitoring** | Performance and adverse impacts tracked |

This is regulation of **deployed systems**, not just the underlying model.

**Procurement policy** reinforces the same shift:
- Agencies must identify reasonably foreseeable use cases
- Determine whether a system is likely to host high-impact use cases as part of acquisition planning

**Enforcement signals** line up with this approach. In 2025, the FTC sued Air AI over allegedly deceptive claims about what its AI-enabled product could do and what users could earn, showing that regulators will keep targeting **real-world system behavior and marketing claims** under existing authorities. ([Federal Trade Commission][3])

### Why It Matters for 2026

In 2026, the practical compliance center of gravity is **operational**: impact assessments, testing, monitoring, documentation, and human oversight tied to specific deployments. That is harder to "paper over" with model-only disclosures.

### What to Watch

- FTC enforcement actions targeting AI system behavior (not just model capabilities)
- Agency AI impact assessments becoming public artifacts
- "High-impact use case" definitions becoming de facto standards
- Compliance programs organized around deployment contexts rather than model versions

## Summary Table: 2026 Predictions

| Prediction | Key 2025 Signal | 2026 Trigger | Primary Source |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **Preemption litigation accelerates** | DOJ AI Litigation Task Force created | Task force case filings begin | Dec 2025 EO ([White House][1]) |
| **Disclosure becomes default artifact** | FCC proceeding ordered; March 2026 procurement deadline | Procurement policy updates; FCC rulemaking | Dec 2025 EO, M-26-04 |
| **Child safety as durable carve-out** | TAKE IT DOWN Act enacted; preemption carve-out | Platform compliance deadlines | TAKE IT DOWN Act ([Congress.gov][2]) |
| **System-level regulation dominates** | High-impact use case framework; FTC Air AI lawsuit | Impact assessments, monitoring become standard | M-25-21, FTC ([FTC][3]) |

## What This Means for Compliance Planning

### Near-Term (Q1-Q2 2026)

1. **Prepare disclosure packets** that work for federal procurement (model cards, testing evidence, monitoring hooks)
2. **Map deployments to "high-impact" criteria** before regulators do it for you
3. **Build notice-and-removal processes** for AI-generated content (TAKE IT DOWN Act compliance)
4. **Track state law status** — enforcement uncertainty is a risk, not an opportunity

### Medium-Term (Q3-Q4 2026)

1. **Watch FCC rulemaking** for federal disclosure standard details
2. **Expect system-level enforcement** from FTC and state AGs targeting marketing claims and real-world harms
3. **Child safety will remain the "third rail"** — build robust controls regardless of other preemption outcomes

## Confidence Levels

| Prediction | Confidence | Basis |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Preemption litigation accelerates | **High** | Task force already created; explicit mandate |
| Disclosure becomes default | **High** | Multiple converging deadlines and mechanisms |
| Child safety carve-out | **Very High** | Bipartisan, explicit EO protection, enacted law |
| System-level regulation | **High** | Already in 2025 frameworks; FTC enforcement pattern |
